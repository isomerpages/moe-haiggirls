##### Character and Leadership through the Performing and Visual Arts

Our LLP aims to develop character and leadership through diverse learning experiences in the Arts. We adopt a whole-school 3-tiered approach to ensure our students develop their creativity, self-expression and appreciation of Singapore’s multi-cultural heritage through the Arts. These learning experiences are also carefully curated to provide opportunities for students to demonstrate values-in-action and develop leadership skills.
