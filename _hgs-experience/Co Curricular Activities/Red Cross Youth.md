### Red Cross Youth

**About Red Cross Youth**

As a Uniformed Group, Red Cross Youth aims to develop a strong sense of social responsibility and discipline in its Links through enriching activities which promote team-work, emergency responsiveness, community involvement and leadership skills. Contrary to common belief, Red Cross Youth not only teaches First Aid, but also trains the Links in areas such as Disaster Management and foot-drill.

**Key Highlights**

Our Links are exposed to various activities and competitions at Red Cross Headquarters such as the Annual Red Cross Flag Day, the National First Aid Championship and Linkamania.

Red Cross Youth Motto - Serve One Another As a humanitarian organization, we are often involved in community involvement programmes, such as Red Cross Flag Day and home visits to the elderly. Our main objective is to help one another as well as the community. We work together as a team and everyone plays a vital part in the work that we do.
