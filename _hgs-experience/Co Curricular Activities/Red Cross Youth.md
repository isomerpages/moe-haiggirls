#### About Red Cross Youth
As a Uniformed Group, Red Cross Youth aims to develop a strong sense of social responsibility and discipline in its Links through enriching activities which promote team-work, emergency responsiveness, community involvement and leadership skills. Contrary to popular belief, Red Cross Youth not only teaches First Aid, but also exposes our Links to topics such as Disaster Management and foot-drills. 

#### Key Highlights
Our Links are exposed to various activities at Red Cross Headquarters and competitions such as the Annual Red Cross Flag Day, the National First Aid Championship and Linkamania.

***Red Cross Youth Motto - Serve One Another***
As a humanitarian organization, we are often involved in community involvement programmes, such as Red Cross Flag Day and home visits to the elderly. Our main objective is to help one another as well as the community. We work together as a team and everyone plays a vital part in the work that we do.
