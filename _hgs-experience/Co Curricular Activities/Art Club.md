### Art Club

We provide opportunities for our members to develop and deepen their interests in visual art. To achieve this objective, we introduce them to different art forms, media and artworks done by artists. We hope to inspire them through the different group activities conducted during the four terms.

Our programme is student-centric. We encourage members to explore their ideas, thoughts, and imagination in a safe environment and express themselves through their works.

We strive to inculcate the following skills and values in our members:

*   Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) Competencies
    
*   21st Century Competencies (21CC) and
    
*   School Values of Integrity, Commitment, Creativity, Concern and Cooperation
    

Key Highlights

Some projects that our members are undertaking in 2023 : 

1\. End of Year Exhibition 

Members curate artworks for this popular and well-received Art Exhibition. Different aspects of planning are involved. They include:

*   Planning the layout and floor map
    
*   Selecting and categorizing artworks done by P1 to P5 schoolmates, D3T2 Art  students as well as Art Club members.
