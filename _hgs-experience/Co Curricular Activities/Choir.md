Key Highlights

  

In HGS Choir, we aim for our students to develop and demonstrate a sense of responsibility, discipline and a passion for singing, through the rich traditions of choral music. The choir sings as an ensemble, and are given many opportunities to perform at various settings. In 2022, they participated in various school events and the biannual Singapore Youth Festival (SYF). Moreover, they were invited to perform for the Joo Chiat Children’s Day Carnival in October 2022, with Minister Tan See Leng gracing the event.
