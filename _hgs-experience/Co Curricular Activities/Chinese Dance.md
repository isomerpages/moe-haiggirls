#### About Chinese Dance
* To develop leadership skills among members and for them to acquire positive values such as team spirit, perseverance, self-discipline and commitment
* To acquire the fundamental skills of Chinese Dance and develop gracefulness, flexibility, balance and body co-ordination in their dance
* To provide opportunities for internal and external performances for authentic learning

#### Key Highlights
Our Chinese Dance members are given opportunities to perform in school events, the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) and external platforms. Through these events, they have worked hard, learned the importance of perseverance and commitment while honing their dance skills. Our members have consistently done the school proud by doing their best and achieving Distinction at the previous 4 SYF Arts Presentations.
