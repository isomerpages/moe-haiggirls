**1\. My daughter has a lot of activities outside school.  She doesn’t have time for CCA.  Can she not join any CCA in the school?**   
  
CCAs are an integral part of our students’ holistic education.  Not only do they discover their interest and talents in a CCA, it also promotes friendships among students from different backgrounds.  Participation in CCA fosters social integration and deepens our students’ sense of belonging.  Therefore, we strongly encourage our students to enrol in at least one CCA in the school.   
  
**2\. My daughter is in P3 and I did not attend the CCA Carnival.  She did not put her name down in any of the CCA booths.  Can she still join the CCA?**   
  
Although we encourage our students to sign up for a CCA at the booth during the CCA Carnival, we also understand the fact that some parents might want to have a discussion with their daughters before committing to a CCA.  Your daughter can definitely enrol herself in a CCA at a later date.  Most of our CCAs will start in Term 1 Week 3.  If your daughter has not signed up for a CCA, she can turn up at the CCA’s first session and inform the teacher-in-charge that she would like to enrol herself in that CCA.  The teachers will be happy to accept her.  (This is with the exception of Bowling CCA, as there is a limit to the number of students we can accept for Bowling, due to the need for transport arrangement and fees collection)   
  
**3\. Can my daughter change her CCA every year?  So that she can experience different CCAs from P3 to P6?**   

Through CCA, not only do students discover interests and talents, it also deepens students’ sense of belonging, commitment and sense of responsibility to school.  It is important for our students to stay committed to one CCA so that they can benefit from the progressive programme through to Primary 6.

  

**4\. Can my daughter enrol in more than 1 CCA?** 

Although CCAs are an integral part of our students' holistic education, there should be a good balance of all the activities for the students to benefit holistically from it. If a student can manage her academics and school activities well, and the time of the CCAs do not clash, she can enrol in more than one CCA.
