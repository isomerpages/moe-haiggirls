##### Frequently Asked Questions

  

**General **

1.  **Is it compulsory for my daughter to enroll in a CCA?**  
 
 CCAs are a key component of students’ holistic education. Through CCAs, students discover their interests and talents. CCAs also provide platforms for students to develop their character, learn values, social emotional competencies and other relevant skills to prepare them for future challenges.
    

  

CCAs bring students from diverse backgrounds together. By learning and interacting with one another, students develop friendships and deepen their sense of belonging to the school and community.

Participation in a CCA is strongly encouraged at the primary level.  
  

2.  **Can my daughter enroll for more than one CCA?**  
 
All CCAs are conducted on Monday afternoons. Due to tiem and commitment, it would not be possible for students to be enrolled in more than one CCA.  
      
    
3.  **How can my daughter make an informed choice of CCA?  **

P2 students will attend compulsory CCA Carnival in Semester 2. Through the carnival, P2 students will engage in hands-on activities to get a glimpse of their CCA experience. They can also interact with student leaders from each CCA to find out more about each CCA.  
      
			
All other students, including transfer students, can find out more about each CCA by:  
    \- Visiting the CCA web pages on the school website  
    \- Approach the HOD PE/CCA  (in-person or via email)  
    \- Approach the respective CCA Teacher-in-charge (in-person or via email)  
      
    

**P3 CCA Registration and Allocation

1.  **When is the CCA Selection and Allocation exercise conducted?  **

The P3 CCA Registration and Allocation process and timeline is as follows:  
    P2 Term 4: CCA Carnival  
    P2 Term 4: CCA Registration (Students submit their preferred choice of cca)  
    P3 Term 1, Week 1: Form teachers will release their CCA Allocation results.  
    P3 Term 1, Week 4: CCA Commence  
    Note: This timeline is subject to changes.  
      
    
2.  **How would you advise students in their selection of CCAs?  **

All CCAs in HGS offer a comprehensive, holistic and engaging student developmental programme that is aimed at maximizing a students’ potential. Beyond the core knowledge and skills, all CCAs provide opportunities to lead and to participate in competitions or performances.  
      
As such, students are strongly encouraged to seek sustained participation in the same CCA from P3-6 to achieve deeper learning and allow for a more complete and fulfilling learning experience.  
      
In selecting their 3 preferred CCAs, students should act responsibly and only select CCAs that they will be ready to commit to and pervere through challenges from P3-6.  
      
While being in the same CCA as their friends/classmates, it should not be the main consideration. Instead, we encourage students to make their choices based on their personal interest and be open to making new friends.  
      
    
3.  **Will my child be allocated to her first choice of CCA?  **

While we strive to meet the students’ diverse needs, with the limited resources, there is a limit to the number of students that each CCA can accept. This is to ensure that the safety and quality of the learning of our students are not compromised.  
      
 As we strive to allocate as many students to their first choice as possible, we seek your understanding that your daughter may not be allocated to her first choice. It is certain that she will be allocated to one of her 3 choices.  
      
    
4.  **How are CCAs being allocated to students?  **

Firstly, we would like to assure parents that the allocation process does not involve any assessment, interview, selection, recommendation, or consideration of past experience. It is also not on a “first come, first served” basis.  
      
We aim to allocate as many students to their first choice as possible. For CCAs that are oversubscribed, a balloting exercise will be conducted to allocate the students.  
      
    
5.  **My daughter was allocated her second choice of CCA. Can we appeal for her first choice?  
**

In alignment to our school values, students are expected to be responsible of the choices that they make and be committed to them. As such, students who have been allocated to one of their 3 choices will not be allowed to make an immediate appeal for a change of CCA unless on medical grounds.  
      
Students can submit their request for change of CCA in the next CCA Registration Exercise at the end of Term 3.  
      
    

**P3-6 Request for Change of CCA

1.  **Can my daughter change her CCA every year for greater exposure? ** 

All CCAs in HGS offer a comprehensive, holistic and engaging student developmental programme that aims to maximize students’ potential. Beyond the core knowledge and skills, all CCAs provide opportunities to lead and to participate in competitions or performances.  
      
As such, students are strongly encouraged to seek sustained participation in the same CCA from P3-6 to achieve deeper learning and allow for a more complete and fulfilling learning experience.  
      
    
2.  **How many times can my daughter change her CCA?  **

Students are strongly encouraged to seek sustained participation in the same CCA from P3-6 to achieve deeper learning and allow for a more complete and fulfilling learning experience. As such, we will only limit ONE change of CCA from P3-6 unless on medical grounds.  
      
    
3.  **How can my daughter request for a change in CCA?**  

The CCA Registration Exercise is conducted every year in Term 4. Students can submit their request via an online Appeal Form. Any submission after the window period will not be considered unless on medical grounds.  
      
The link to the online Appeal Form will be disseminated to ALL students via SLS during the window period.  
      
All request are subject to availability of vacancy in the CCA of choice. The results of the request will be released by Term 1 Week 2 the following year, before the commencement of CCAs in Term 1 Week 4.
