**About Soccer**

Thinking of joining a Sports CCA? Look no further! How cool is it to tell everyone that you are in Soccer CCA in a girls’ school?

Joining Soccer is not just about learning how to play Soccer. It helps develop you into a resilient and confident athlete.

Objectives of Soccer CCA:

*   To develop fundamental motor skills and understanding of game concepts
    
*   To acquire soccer skills and techniques with emphasis on sports-related and team-building activities
    
*   To learn importance of values like self-discipline, determination and teamwork
    
*   To develop social integration and develop a sense of belonging
    
*   To demonstrate Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) competencies, 21st century competencies (21CC) and school values (Integrity, Commitment, Creativity, Concern and Cooperation)
    

**Key Highlights**

Through commitment and passion for the game, our Soccer team has consistently achieved a Top 4 placing in the National School Games Football Championship every year since 2010.

Opportunities are also provided for students who are not part of the school team. At the end of each year, all students will take part in the FAS Soccer Festival, a friendly competition where students can apply what they have learnt during CCA and have more exposure to the beautiful game.
