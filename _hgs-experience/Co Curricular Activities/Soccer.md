<p><strong>About Soccer</strong>
</p>
<p>Thinking of joining a Sports CCA? Look no further! How cool is it to tell
everyone that you are in Soccer CCA in a girlsâ€™ school?</p>
<p>Joining Soccer is not just about learning how to play Soccer. It helps
develop you into a resilient and confident athlete.</p>
<p>Objectives of Soccer CCA:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To develop fundamental motor skills and understanding of game concepts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To acquire soccer skills and techniques with emphasis on sports-related
and team-building activities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To learn importance of values like self-discipline, determination and
teamwork</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To develop social integration and develop a sense of belonging</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To demonstrate Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) competencies, 21st
century competencies (21CC) and school values (Integrity, Commitment, Creativity,
Concern and Cooperation)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Highlights</strong>
</p>
<p>Through commitment and passion for the game, our Soccer team has consistently
achieved a Top 4 placing in the National School Games Football Championship
every year since 2010.</p>
<p>Opportunities are also provided for students who are not part of the school
team. At the end of each year, all students will take part in the FAS Soccer
Festival, a friendly competition where students can apply what they have
learnt during CCA and have more exposure to the beautiful game.</p>
