**About Wushu**

Objectives To enable pupils to acquire Wushu knowledge, skills and concepts with emphasis on developmentally-appropriate activities

*   To enable pupils to build a strong foundation in fundamental motor skills and movement concepts
    
*   To expose pupils to the cultural understanding of Wushu
    
*   To instill discipline and responsibility in the spirit of Wushu
    
*   To enable pupils to experience and acquire Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) competencies , 21st century competencies (21CC) and school values (Integrity, Commitment, Creativity, Concern and Cooperation) during CCA
    

**Key Highlights**

Our Wushu students are given opportunities to perform in school events like Chinese New Year Celebration and Speech Day. Selected students also train hard for the National School Games Wushu Championships every year and have consistently proven themselves on the National platform.

Students enjoy Wushu because they learn to protect themselves while staying healthy. Their weekly training instills self-discipline in them, and this can also be applied to their school work. During CCA, they will be taught how to take care of the weapons that they use, instilling a sense of responsibility. Though training can be tiring at times, they build resilience and tenacity as they spur one another on. As they work with their peers on their Wushu journey, they learn the value of teamwork and form friendships for life.
