We aim to

*   develop every science club member’s skills and knowledge in observing, thinking, testing and investigating the natural phenomena around them
    
*   allow students to apply the knowledge of Science to understand the environmental issues facing Earth and raise everyone’s awareness of these issues.
    

Students are introduced to science concepts beyond the primary science syllabus.

Some of the exciting science concepts that they learn through hands-on experiments include acid-and-base reactions (chemistry) that give food interesting colours, and the science of physics like air pressure and densities of liquids.

They make posters and design quizzes to remind their schoolmates to conserve electricity and to save water.
