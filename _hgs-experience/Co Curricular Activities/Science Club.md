#### About the Science Club

 We aim to
* develop every science club member’s skills and knowledge in observing, thinking, testing and investigating about the natural phenomenon around them
* allow students to apply the knowledge of Science to understand the environmental issues facing Earth and raise awareness of these issues with everyone in HGS

#### Key Highlights

Students are introduced to science concepts beyond the primary science syllabus.

Some of the exciting science concepts that they learnt through hands-on experiments include acid-and-base reactions (chemistry) that gives food interesting colours, and the science of physics like air pressure and densities of liquids.

*The upper primary students are also actively involved in raising awareness of environmental education in the school. They make posters and design quizzes to remind their schoolmates to conserve electricity and to save water.*
