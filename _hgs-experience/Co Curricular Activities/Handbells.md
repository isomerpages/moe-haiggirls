#### About Handbells
We develop our studentsâ€™ character, musical knowledge and passion for handbells. We want them to live the values of cooperation, commitment, concern and discipline through our CCA and beyond. They learn all these and more when they ring their assigned bells to make beautiful music together. Not only do they grow to be confident musicians, they forge strong friendships and create everlasting memories with their fellow HGS ringers.

#### Key Highlights
HGS Handbells Ensemble members are given opportunities to perform in various school events, the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) and external platforms (e.g., the Marine Parade National Day Dinner 2019). The ensemble has attained many remarkable achievements through the years, such as the Certificate of Distinction at the Singapore Youth Festival 2014 and the Certificate of Accomplishment in 2016 and 2018.
