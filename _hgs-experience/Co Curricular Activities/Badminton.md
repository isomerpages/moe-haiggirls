### Badminton

  

**About Badminton**

Objectives

1.  To develop a passion for Badminton
    
2.  To learn values and life skills (e.g. communication, decision-making, leadership and teamwork) through training and competition
    
3.  To foster social integration and deepen their sense of belonging
    
4.  To expose students to basic Badminton skills
    

**Key Highlights**

Besides imparting a variety of Badminton footwork and skills, our CCA strives to build resilience through the training sessions. In Badminton, our students build physical fitness and are taught skills, rules, tactics and strategies to play the game. At the same time, there are many authentic opportunities for students to develop their character strength such as discipline, mental endurance and determination as well as demonstrate values related to sportsmanship and teamwork.

Our girls are also given leadership opportunities to organise various activities for their peers  such as warm-up games, footwork drills and the format for match fixtures.
