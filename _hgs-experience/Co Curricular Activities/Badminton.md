Badminton is a sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net.  It is one of the most popular sports in Singapore, where age is not a limit.  Haig Girlsâ€™ School has a recreational group of badminton players as well as a competitive group which represents the school in competitions.  Regardless of which groups they are in, students are given opportunities to hone their skills against their peers and participate in the East Zone Badminton Championship and Intra-school competitions.  For Badminton school team players, they do have holiday trainings in preparation for East Zone Badminton Championship.  

Above all, students get to enjoy the sport while playing with their friends and understanding the true meaning of sportsmanship.
