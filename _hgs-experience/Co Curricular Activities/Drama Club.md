#### About Drama Club
*“All the world’s a stage; and all the men and women merely players.” – William Shakespeare*

Haig Girls’ School Drama Club welcomes those who jump at the opportunity to perform and enjoy learning about the world through the eyes of different characters. Drama Club members are exposed to various performance skills such as voice projection and speech clarity, staging skills, movement and space, and improvisation amongst others. On top of that, Drama Club provides opportunities for members to collaborate effectively by emphasizing on communication, conflict management and listening and responding respectfully as they work in groups to design and stage skits. Teamwork makes the dream work, so we hope to journey along with our members as we develop a deep sense of appreciation for the performing arts in them. 

#### Key Highlights
Our Drama Club members are given opportunities to perform skits in school during assembly programmes or recess activities in the library. In 2018, as part of the post-exam activities, the Drama Club treated the school to their first ever play titled ‘Tiger, Brahman and the Fox’ .

Drama girls also participate in various national competitions. Internal auditions are held, providing a realistic mock-up for our members to apply the skills they have learnt during CCA and build on their resilience and self-esteem. During competitions, the key message for our members is that winning is a bonus but more importantly, they must have fun in the process. 

Our Drama girls are committed to doing their best for both internal and external performances.

* The Moo-O Awards 2018 – Gold Award
* Newsmaker Awards 2018 – Gold Award
* Babble & Speak 2018 – Merit Award
* Speak Up! Kids 2018 Public Speaking Competition – 2nd Runner Up
