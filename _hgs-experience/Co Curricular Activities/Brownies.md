**About Brownies**

Under the caring supervision of the teacher-guiders, Brownies work independently - to earn various interest/proficiency badges & awards - and in collaborative teams during learning journeys, workshops and camps.

For more information on Brownies activities, programmes, badges & awards, do refer to GGS website - [girlguides.org.sg](https://girlguides.org.sg/)
