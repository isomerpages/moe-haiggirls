#### About Brownies

As a Uniformed Group, that is also a part of Girl Guides Singapore (GGS), Brownies are given unparalleled opportunities to discover and develop their strengths, their skills and their fullest potential, to become responsible citizens of the world, through our unique 5-Point Programme.

Under the caring supervision of the teacher-guiders, Brownies work independently - to earn various interest/proficiency badges & awards - and in collaborative teams during learning journeys, workshops and camps.

For more information on Brownies activities, programmes, badges & awards, do refer to GGS website - [_girlguides.org.sg_](https://girlguides.org.sg/)

#### Key Highlights

Brownies regularly join other Brownie or Girl Guide units for joint learning adventures and competitions, such as World Thinking Day, Division Days, outdoor cooking and camping.

Brownies are also given unparalleled opportunities to participate in various workshops and activities organized by GGS and its partners such as the _BAE She Solves Badge Programme_, _Leadership Mindset_ _Workshop_, _Financial Literacy Programme_ and _Surf Smart Workshop_, among others.
