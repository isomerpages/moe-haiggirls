#### About Modern Dance
We aim to develop confident and well-rounded dancers through our Modern Dance CCA programme. We encourage our students to discover their interests and talents, build sound character and values, and develop leadership skills. 

#### Key Highlights
Our Modern Dance students are given opportunities to perform in school events, the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) and external platforms. They are encouraged to give their full commitment in all the dance practices and be a role model to others in everything they do.

“I feel a great sense of satisfaction when I perform the new moves that I learned in front of an audience. I also learnt the importance of helping one another when we face difficulties, so that we can achieve our goals together. Through Modern Dance, I have learnt to persevere and not give up so easily.” – Modern Dance CCA Student Leader
