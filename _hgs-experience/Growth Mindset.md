<h2><u>Growth Mindset</u></h2>
<p>At Haig Girls’ School , we place a strong emphasis on fostering a growth
mindset, empowering students to embrace challenges, learn from mistakes,
and continuously strive for improvement. Through our Character and Citizenship
Education (CCE) lessons, academic subjects, and key student development
experiences, we incorporate a growth mindset approach in all that we do.
This mindset encourages students to see their brains as muscles that grow
stronger with effort, practice, and perseverance.</p>
<p>Our growth mindset messages are woven throughout our learning culture:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Mindset Matters – Your brain is like a muscle—the more you challenge it,
the stronger it gets!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Power of Yet – You may not know it yet, but with effort and practice,
you will get there!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mistakes Help Us Grow – It’s all right to make mistakes—what matters is
how I learn from them and improve!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resilience Builds Strength – When things get tough, don’t give up—keep
trying, and you’ll come back even stronger!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learning Happens Together – I can learn from others, ask for help, use
different strategies, and apply feedback to grow and improve!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Challenges Help Me Grow – Every challenge is a chance to learn, improve,
and become stronger!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In today’s rapidly changing world, the ability to stay resilient and adaptable
is more important than ever. At Haig Girls’ School, we believe that every
challenge is an opportunity for growth, and through our programme, students
learn that it is all right to make mistakes - they are simply stepping
stones to success. By promoting resilience, self-reflection, and the value
of learning together, we nurture confident, self-aware individuals who
are ready to face challenges with determination and to make a positive
impact in their communities.</p>
