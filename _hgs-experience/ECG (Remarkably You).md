<h2><strong><u>Remarkably You @ HGS</u></strong></h2>
<p>At Haig Girls, <em>Remarkably You</em> is a signature programme designed
to guide students on their journey of self-discovery. It encourages them
to explore their unique qualities, strengths, and talents, while fostering
both academic and character growth. Through a series of engaging activities,
including recess workshops and CCE(FTGP) lessons, students reflect on their
aspirations, discover new interests, and engage in meaningful self-reflection.
<br>
</p>
<p>Through <em>Remarkably You</em>, our students embark on a progressive journey
from Primary 1 to 6 that nurtures identity, voice, and purpose. Each level
offers thoughtfully designed experiences that help students understand
themselves, build personal strengths, develop practical life skills, and
contribute meaningfully to their community. Along the way, they grow into
confident, self-aware individuals equipped with resilience, adaptability,
and a growth mindset—skills essential for thriving in today's world.</p>

<h2><strong><u>Exploring Career Opportunities</u></strong></h2>
<p>In addition to fostering self-discovery, students explore various career
options through talks by alumnae, industry professionals, and special guest
speakers. These sessions offer valuable insights into different fields,
guiding students in making informed decisions about their future career
paths. Through the Education and Career Guidance (ECG) program, we aim
to empower students to become confident, purpose-driven individuals, ready
to embrace opportunities and challenges with a strong sense of self.</p>
