Haig Girls’ has implemented innovative programmes which integrate the arts with other disciplines. 

#### Arts as Pedagogy: Teaching Mathematics through Drama
Drama techniques are incorporated in the learning of Maths through the Teaching Through The Arts (TTTA) pedagogy. Designed in collaboration with the National Arts Council (NAC) and a School Of The Arts (SOTA) drama practitioner, this programme aims to stimulate pupils’ interest in Maths and develop their Maths conceptual understanding and problem-solving skills.

### Infusion of Speech and Drama techniques into the English Language Curriculum
**Primary 1 to Primary 2**   
Speech and Drama techniques are infused into the EL curriculum to develop pupils to speak confidently and clearly in internationally acceptable English and persuasively in an engaging manner.

**Primary 3 to Primary 6**   
Speech and Drama techniques are used to explore literary elements, such as fleshing out the characters using “Hot seating” and “Conscience Alley” when reading a text critically, and developing the story line using “Freeze Frames” when writing a narrative.

### Infusion of Drama and Songs in the Teaching and Learning of Malay Language and Tamil Language
##### Teaching and Learning (Infusion of Drama)
**Primary 1 to Primary 2**   
Pupils engage in individual role play and act in groups during lessons to better understand the situations of the stories found in their textbooks or based on stories they have read. Pupils use puppets and masks they have made for the role playing and group acts.

**Primary 3 to Primary 6**    
Pupils engage in individual role play and act in groups during lessons to better understand the stories based on Malay legends found in their textbooks or based on stories they have read. Primary 3 and 4 pupils also use puppets to act out scenarios.

##### Teaching and Learning (Infusion of Songs)
**Primary 1 to Primary 4**   
Children’s songs and Malay/Tamil folk songs are used during teaching and learning to instil pupil’s interest in Malay Language and Tamil Language.

**Primary 5 to Primary 6**   
Traditional and modern Malay/Tamil songs are being used as part of teaching and learning of Malay Language and Tamil Language.

*\*Drama and songs are also used for the teaching and learning of Civics and Moral Education at all levels.*
