In Haig Girls’ School, we believe that our girls can think, learn, achieve & excel. 

We seek to nurture the student as an inquirer, who enjoy science and value science as an important tool in helping them explore their natural and physical world. The inculcation of the spirit of scientific inquiry are in three domains - (a) Knowledge, Understanding and Application, (b) Skills and Process and (c) Ethics and Attitudes.
  
Our Science curriculum also aligns with itself our school goals with the ultimate goal of developing our pupils to be self-directed, confident and adaptive 21st century learners.
