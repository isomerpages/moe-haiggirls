<h2><strong><u>Applied Learning Program (ALP)</u></strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Innovation and Service Learning through Integrated Project Work</strong></h3>
<p>Haig Girls’ School has developed a distinctive approach to Integrated
Project Work (IPW) that involves inter-disciplinary, place-based learning
and/or authentic problem solving, service learning and value creation.
Each project is designed to develop 21st century competencies such as self-directed
learning, collaboration, critical and creative thinking and civic literacy
and achieve the desired student outcomes where our Haig girls will be confident
persons, self-directed learners, active contributors and concerned citizens.</p>
