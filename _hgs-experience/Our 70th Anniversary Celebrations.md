<p>HGS turns 70 this year, and in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. This
meant the&nbsp;traditional modes of celebrating our anniversaries such
as a gala dinner, whole-school&nbsp;in-person celebrations and performances,
could no longer be held due to the need for&nbsp;social distancing. Even
so, we were determined to overcome the hurdles placed in our&nbsp;way,
and to commemorate our 70th Anniversary as meaningfully as possible. This
included:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Whole-school student engagement sessions by our Drama Club students via
Zoom, who came up with trivia quizzes and Kahoot games to help everyone&nbsp;better
appreciate&nbsp;the&nbsp;school’s past</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Whole school effort in showing our appreciation and gratitude for
frontline workers, including putting together 600 Bags of Blessings for
migrant workers</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We rounded off the school year by celebrating our 70th Anniversary on
Thursday, 18&nbsp;Nov and Friday,&nbsp;19 Nov. We celebrated the following
milestones of our students, staff&nbsp;and stakeholders, such as:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>70 years of our HGS heritage and identity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Official opening of HGS’s upgraded campus at Koon Seng Road</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>10 th year anniversary of our TIMEOUT / Think! Contemporary Programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The graduation of our P6 students from Haig Girls’ School</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The diverse successes of our students and staff (the integration of our
usual Prize-Giving Day into our 70th Anniversary celebrations)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of the school’s 70th Anniversary celebrations, the Drama Club
put together a&nbsp;special '<strong><a href="https://youtu.be/88yL-2Nv_Q0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Our HGS Heritage</a>'</strong>&nbsp;video
which takes us through the rich history of our school&nbsp;and gives us
a greater awareness of&nbsp;our beautiful HGS Heritage Learning Spaces&nbsp;around
the school.</p>

<p>The Drama students and teachers alike have put in many tireless&nbsp;hours
to film what's required - with our P3-5 (doing voice-overs) and 2021 P6
graduating&nbsp;seniors acting to the voiceovers of their juniors;&nbsp;
a novel idea to circumvent the various&nbsp;SMM measures where our students
could not physically mingle with other students&nbsp;beyond their class.
This was definitely a whole CCA project which successfully managed to bring
together the involvement of every single member of the drama club in&nbsp;one
way or&nbsp;another and really showcases our students living out the school
motto -&nbsp;“Ars&nbsp;Potens Est” (Knowledge is Power in service to others,
the school and the&nbsp;community.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes, it really isn't just about talking the talk, but really walking
the talk. Let's take&nbsp;a look at how our students have really '<strong><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19xerTKdaU6OeajBzhiSIErnj0Cfnv2Vr/view?usp=sharing" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Walked the Talk</a>'</strong>&nbsp;and
given back to our society in&nbsp;other ways. As you have seen, advocacy
is really at the heart of all our Haig Girls. The&nbsp;school has conducted
many school-wide&nbsp;programmes through the years that everyone&nbsp;has
taken part in and enjoyed. Some examples of such programs include Reading
for&nbsp;Books, sharing our Bags of Blessings with the migrant workers,&nbsp;Walk
for Rice, just to&nbsp;name a few. It is truly evident that we are never
too young to make a difference!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Very often, we only see what's on the surface but seldom get to see the
many precious&nbsp;unsung heroes who are working so hard behind the scenes
just to get things running&nbsp;day in and out. We are truly very blessed
as a HGS family, to have all our precious&nbsp;members relentlessly going
beyond the call of duty just to make our school a conducive&nbsp;and safe
place for our students to learn and grow in. Presenting to you '<strong><a href="https://youtu.be/GQuKFrE6fXE" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Our People Our Pride</a></strong>'<strong>.</strong>&nbsp;Heartfelt
thanks to our school staff, Parents Support Group (PSG) and School&nbsp;Advisory
Council&nbsp;(SAC) for making this possible.</p>

<p>As we say goodbye to 2021 and welcome 2022 with open arms, it is a good
time to&nbsp;reflect as we unwind. Surely there have been moments where
we wished we could&nbsp;have/should have done something, persevered through
hardships and yet grown&nbsp;stronger and wiser through them. We took the
opportunity to hear what our friends and&nbsp;teachers had gone through
on their first day of school. Check out their reflections&nbsp;through&nbsp;'<strong><a href="https://youtu.be/Vz4ftvEE_9k" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">A Guide to Tomorrow</a>'</strong>.</p>

<p>No matter what the future holds, the friendships forged&nbsp;in primary
school are here to stay as we all look forward to a brand new day and&nbsp;embrace
the challenges each day brings. Sometimes, what we think was or could be&nbsp;hard,
may not turn out to be so, in hindsight, and everything truly happens for
a reason.</p>
<p>Haig Girls’ has certainly come a long way with our Past, Present and Future
and we&nbsp;hope that everyone has re-lived some of these special moments
and journey with HaigGirls' through the above videos which were first aired
on 19 Nov, 2021&nbsp;(HGS 70th AV&nbsp;Celebrations). While we may not
have been able to celebrate the achievements&nbsp;of our&nbsp;pupils together
physically this year, we hope watching these clips can give you a glimpse
of this virtual celebration specially curated for each and every one of
you.&nbsp; Time&nbsp;for one last "<strong><a href="https://youtu.be/dyvNyMfjgqc" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Behind the Scenes</a>"</strong>&nbsp;before
we say goodbye!</p>
