<u>Virtual immersion with Vietnam Le Quy Don Primary School 2022</u>

  

The COVID-19 pandemic situation brought a halt to physical travel for the school’s Internationalisation Program. As such, we decided to embark on a virtual immersion programme for our P4 students this year. 

The 5 classes of P4 students participated in this year’s overseas immersion programme as their post-examination activities. It was conducted via two zoom sessions with a Vietnamese local guide and the students from Le Quy Don Primary School.  

  

On 7 November, our girls joined the Vietnamese guide to tour around Ho Chi Minh City and the Cu Chi Tunnel. They also learnt about the Vietnamese culture and get to paint Vietnamese hats.  

On 14 November, our girls interacted with the Vietnamese students and shared information about our country and our school niche programme – TIME-OUT.  Students from both countries learn more about Singapore and Vietnam. Our girls were glad to participate in this immersion programme which enabled them to interact with their overseas counterpart virtually.
