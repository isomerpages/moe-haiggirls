HGS turns 70 this year, and in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. This meant the traditional modes of celebrating our anniversaries such as a gala dinner, whole-school in-person celebrations and performances, could no longer be held due to the need for social distancing. Even so, we were determined to overcome the hurdles placed in our way, and to commemorate our 70th Anniversary as meaningfully as possible. This included:

  

*   Whole-school student engagement sessions by our Drama Club students via Zoom, who came up with trivia quizzes and Kahoot games to help everyone better appreciate the school’s past

*    Whole school effort in showing our appreciation and gratitude for frontline workers, including putting together 600 Bags of Blessings for migrant workers

 We rounded off the school year by celebrating our 70th Anniversary on Thursday, 18 Nov and Friday, 19 Nov. We celebrated the following milestones of our students, staff and stakeholders, such as:

  

*   70 years of our HGS heritage and identity
*   Official opening of HGS’s upgraded campus at Koon Seng Road
*   10 th year anniversary of our TIMEOUT / Think! Contemporary Programme
*   The graduation of our P6 students from Haig Girls’ School
*   The diverse successes of our students and staff (the integration of our usual Prize-Giving Day into our 70th Anniversary celebrations)

As part of the school’s 70th Anniversary celebrations, the Drama Club put together a special '**[Our HGS Heritage](https://youtu.be/88yL-2Nv_Q0)'** video which takes us through the rich history of our school and gives us a greater awareness of our beautiful HGS Heritage Learning Spaces around the school.

The Drama students and teachers alike have put in many tireless hours to film what's required - with our P3-5 (doing voice-overs) and 2021 P6 graduating seniors acting to the voiceovers of their juniors;  a novel idea to circumvent the various SMM measures where our students could not physically mingle with other students beyond their class. This was definitely a whole CCA project which successfully managed to bring together the involvement of every single member of the drama club in one way or another and really showcases our students living out the school motto - “Ars Potens Est” (Knowledge is Power in service to others, the school and the community.)  

  

Sometimes, it really isn't just about talking the talk, but really walking the talk. Let's take a look at how our students have really '**[Walked the Talk](https://youtu.be/_cgWO8Nm3kE)'** and given back to our society in other ways. As you have seen, advocacy is really at the heart of all our Haig Girls. The school has conducted many school-wide programmes through the years that everyone has taken part in and enjoyed. Some examples of such programs include Reading for Books, sharing our Bags of Blessings with the migrant workers, Walk for Rice, just to name a few. It is truly evident that we are never too young to make a difference!

Very often, we only see what's on the surface but seldom get to see the many precious unsung heroes who are working so hard behind the scenes just to get things running day in and out. We are truly very blessed as a HGS family, to have all our precious members relentlessly going beyond the call of duty just to make our school a conducive and safe place for our students to learn and grow in. Presenting to you '[**Our People Our Pride**](https://youtu.be/GQuKFrE6fXE)'**.** Heartfelt thanks to our school staff, Parents Support Group (PSG) and School Advisory Council (SAC) for making this possible.

As we say goodbye to 2021 and welcome 2022 with open arms, it is a good time to reflect as we unwind. Surely there have been moments where we wished we could have/should have done something, persevered through hardships and yet grown stronger and wiser through them. We took the opportunity to hear what our friends and teachers had gone through on their first day of school. Check out their reflections through '**[A Guide to Tomorrow](https://youtu.be/Vz4ftvEE_9k)'**.

No matter what the future holds, the friendships forged in primary school are here to stay as we all look forward to a brand new day and embrace the challenges each day brings. Sometimes, what we think was or could be hard, may not turn out to be so, in hindsight, and everything truly happens for a reason.

Haig Girls’ has certainly come a long way with our Past, Present and Future and we hope that everyone has re-lived some of these special moments and journey with HaigGirls' through the above videos which were first aired on 19 Nov, 2021 (HGS 70th AV Celebrations). While we may not have been able to celebrate the achievements of our pupils together physically this year, we hope watching these clips can give you a glimpse of this virtual celebration specially curated for each and every one of you. 
Time for one last "**[Behind the Scenes](https://youtu.be/dyvNyMfjgqc)"** before we say goodbye!
