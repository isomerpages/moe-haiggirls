<center><em>Ars Potens Est - Knowledge is Power, in service to others, the school and the community.</em></center>

  

These simple but powerful words of our school motto embodies our HGS spirit of advocacy and service to the community, where we believe that no Haig girl is too young to make a difference. 

Our Haig girls are thus empowered to be advocates for causes that they are passionate about, which includes showing kindness and gratitude to others and the community. 

We collaborated with various partners for our Values-In-Action (VIA) programs

*   Bags of Blessings to groups in need
    
*   Walk for Rice @ South East
    
*   Read for Books with National Library Board (NLB)
    
*   Clean Plate Campaign with Food from the Heart

  

**_<u>Bags of Blessing during the celebration of Racial Harmony Day and National Day 2021</u>_**

 In 2021, Haig girls celebrated Racial Harmony Day and National Day by showing appreciation to migrant workers in Singapore.

 On National Day, we showed our appreciation to migrant workers by packing 600 "Bags of Blessings" for our migrant workers from five dormitories.

 Our Haig girls also prepared personalised cards and videos to recognise the efforts of our essential workers, such as our food delivery heroes, school cleaners, healthcare officers, supermarket staff, airport crew and frontliners at our vaccination centres.

 Our students learned that it is truly a blessing to give and they are able to make a difference to the lives  

of others.

  

**_<u>Read for Books</u>_**

Read for Books is a charity book drive organised by the National Reading Movement, National Library Board. It aims to raise awareness and share the gift of reading with the less privileged. For every 10 people who read for 15 minutes, one book will be donated to selected beneficiaries. In 2021, as a school, we read a total of 103,427 minutes, which translated to a donation of 911 books. We are glad to have contributed to such a worthy cause. Well done, Haig Girls!

**_<u>Clean Plate Campaign 2021</u>_**  

The Clean Plate Campaign, organised by Food from the Heart, aims to raise students' awareness of the problems caused by food wastage and to learn about the importance of finishing up the food on their plate during mealtimes. For every "clean plate" recorded from our students, $1 will be donated to the needy. 

We are proud to share that in 2021, we achieved 3,238 clean plates over four days. As a school, we had raised $3,238 for the needy, raised awareness of the issues arising from food wastage and also learned to cultivate better eating habits.
