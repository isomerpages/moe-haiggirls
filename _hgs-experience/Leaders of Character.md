Ars Potens Est - Knowledge is Power, in service to others, the school and the community.

These simple but powerful words of our school motto embodies our HGS spirit of advocacy and service to the community, where we believe that no Haig girl is too young to make a difference. 

Our Haig girls are thus empowered to be advocates for causes that they are passionate about, which include showing kindness and gratitude to others and the community. 

We have collaborated with various partners for our Values-In-Action (VIA) programs:

*   Bags of Blessings 
    
*   Read for Books with National Library Board (NLB)
    
*   Clean Plate Campaign
    
*   HGS PSG Charity Book Drive
    
*   Walk for Rice @ South East
    

**Bags of Blessings**

Held in conjunction with the commemoration of National Day, our Haig Girls, staff, Parents Support Group and School Advisory Committee would come together to prepare Bags of Blessings for various groups of people (e.g. lower income groups, the migrant workers, frontline workers, less fortunate children etc). These bags would contain essential items specially curated for the respective groups. Our students have learnt that it is truly a blessing to be able to give and make a difference to the lives of others.

**Read for Books with National Library Board (NLB)**

Read for Books is a charity book drive organised by the National Reading Movement, National Library Board. It aims to raise awareness and share the gift of reading with the less privileged. For every 10 people who read for 15 minutes, one book will be donated to selected beneficiaries. We are glad to be able to contribute to such a worthy cause on a yearly basis.

**Clean Plate Campaign **

The Clean Plate Campaign, organised by Food from the Heart, aims to raise students’ awareness of the problems caused by food wastage and to learn about the importance of finishing up the food on their plates during mealtimes. For every “clean plate” recorded by our students, $1 will be donated to the needy. Haig Girls has been actively involved in this yearly affair as we recognise the importance of reducing food wastage and cultivating better eating habits while contributing to the society.![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p3UeqELrPHIJ_yxZTz_dBb9FnkwTwXvQ2_eMk175MG8iPZx_9sQwTDzCM125Ar2FF-cj5PUSGUgq53KY3RCtmsny4JCxBU0-0uvxkQL08rHN6WGku-VYQvrL8FAdsmeCYF478aCiMHXq)

**HGS PSG Charity Book Drive**

Our Parents Support Group has been actively involved in organising this yearly Charity Book Drive as they strongly believe in giving back to the school and supporting the less-privileged students in our midst. Our Haig Girls and their families are very supportive of this drive and would bring in tonnes of pre-loved books from home to support this worthy cause.

Every year, as part of Children’s Day, Haig Girls participate in the South East CDC Walk-For-Rice programme. This is a simple activity involves walking to raise rice for the less-privileged families in the South East District.
