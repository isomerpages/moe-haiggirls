<h2><strong><u>Learning for Life Programme</u></strong></h2>
<p>The Learning for Life Programme (LLP) at Haig Girls’ School builds character
and leadership through the Arts. A school-wide, three-tiered approach across
all six levels helps students develop creativity, self-expression, and
appreciation of Singapore’s multi-cultural heritage through the domains
for art, dance, drama and music. Learning experiences are curated to provide
real-life applications, values-in-action opportunities, and leadership
growth.</p>
<p>Aligned with the school’s vision and mission, the LLP fosters 21st century
competencies such as inventive thinking, responsible decision-making, and
care for self and others. It offers meaningful, age-appropriate experiences
that encourage experimentation, collaboration, self-discovery, and the
joy of learning through showcases and student-led initiatives.</p>

<h5>Character and Leadership through the Performing and Visual Arts</h5>
<p>Our LLP aims to develop character and leadership through diverse learning
experiences in the Arts. We adopt a whole-school 3-tiered approach to ensure
our students develop their creativity, self-expression and appreciation
of Singapore’s multi-cultural heritage through the Arts. These learning
experiences are also carefully curated to provide opportunities for students
to demonstrate values-in-action and develop leadership skills.</p>
