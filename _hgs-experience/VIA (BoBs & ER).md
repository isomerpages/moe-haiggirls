<h2><strong><u>The HGS Values in Action (VIA) Experience</u></strong></h2>
<p>Values in Action (VIA) is a key component of Character and Citizenship
Education (CCE 2021), nurturing socially responsible citizens who actively
contribute to their communities. VIA encourages students to explore their
identity, understand their impact on others, and take ownership of their
role within their families, school, and the broader world.</p>
<p>Guided by our motto, <em>Ars Potens Est</em> (Knowledge is Power, in Service
to Others, the School and the Community), and our vision of empowering
every Haig girl to learn and lead in service of others, VIA fosters advocacy,
gratitude, and leadership. Through these experiences, students develop
meaningful relationships, deepen their sense of responsibility, and grow
into individuals who make a difference.</p>

<p>The HGS VIA Framework</p>
<p>The HGS VIA Framework framework illustrates how we empower every Haig
Girl to learn, lead, and serve, underpinned by our six school values. The
tiers represent school-wide, cohort-wide and project-based, while surrounding
the framework are the SEL competencies that support and deepen the VIA
experiences.</p>
<p>Two key school-wide VIA activities that every Haig girl can look forward
to are:</p>
<h3><strong><u>Everyday Responsibilities</u></strong></h3>
<p>A&nbsp;clean and organised environment reflects a sense of responsibility,
respect, and care for the spaces we share. Through Everyday Responsibilities,
students take ownership of their surroundings by actively contributing
to the cleanliness of their classrooms and school environment.</p>
<p>Each student plays a role in maintaining the classroom through daily duties,
ensuring that shared spaces remain tidy and conducive for learning. Before
dismissal, everyone takes part in a 5-minute clean-up, working together
to restore order to their work areas and common spaces.</p>
<p>Beyond keeping the school clean, these daily routines are a form of Values
in Action (VIA), reinforcing responsibility, teamwork, and respect for
shared spaces. By making cleanliness a habit, students develop a sense
of accountability and pride in their environment, fostering a culture of
care within the school community.</p>

<h3><strong><u>Bags of Blessings</u></strong></h3>
<p><em>Bags of Blessings (BoBs)</em> is a uniquely Haig Girls’ initiative
that brings our school community together in the spirit of joy and kindness.
In celebration of National Day, Haig Girls, along with our dedicated staff,
Parents Support Group, and School Advisory Committee, unite to create thoughtful
gift bags for elderly residents in selected homes. Each carefully curated
bag, filled with essentials like toiletries, snacks, and comfort items,
is a heartfelt reminder of the power of giving back to the community.</p>
<p>This project also offers our students the meaningful opportunity to connect
with the elderly, engage in heartfelt conversations, and spend quality
time with them. As part of the initiative, students write personalised
notes or cards to accompany the gift bags, adding a personal touch that
brightens the recipients' day and reminds them that they are valued and
appreciated. Through Bags of Blessings, Haig Girls not only learn the importance
of service and community but also deepen their understanding of respecting
and caring for our elderly.</p>
<p>Aligned with our motto <em>Ars Potens Est</em> (Knowledge is Power) and
the school’s vision of empowering every Haig Girl to lead in service to
others, Bags of Blessings serves as a powerful reminder that regardless
of their age, every Haig Girl has the ability to make a meaningful difference
in the lives of others.</p>
