<h2><strong><u>Home School Partnership</u></strong></h2>
<p>A strong collaboration between parents and teachers is essential to creating
a positive and supportive environment for the holistic development of our
children.</p>
<p>To strengthen this partnership, the Ministry of Education (MOE) has introduced
refreshed <em>Guidelines for School-Home Partnership (GSHP)</em>. These
guidelines were announced by Minister for Education Chan Chun Sing at Schools
Work Plan Seminar on 18 September 2024.</p>
<p>Together, schools and parents will work to raise a happy, confident and
kind generation by:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Communicating with each other respectfully</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being positive role models for our children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supporting our children in building strong relationships and healthy habits
in the digital age.</p>
</li>
</ul>
