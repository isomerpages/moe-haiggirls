<h4><strong><u>Alumnae Events</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>2024 Alumnae Gathering – <em>A Walk Down Memory Lane</em></strong>
</p>
<p>On 29 June 2024, we organised an alumnae gathering titled <em>A Walk Down Memory Lane</em>.
It was heartening to see our alumnae reconnect with old friends, reminisce
about their school days, and share their journeys since leaving Haig Girls’
School. The laughter, stories, and camaraderie were a powerful reminder
of the strong bonds that unite our community. The enthusiasm and active
participation of our alumnae contributed greatly to the success of the
event.</p>
<p><strong>2025 Alumnae Gathering – <em>Threads That Bind Us</em></strong>
</p>
<p><strong><em><br></em></strong>On 12 July 2025, we held our alumnae gathering <em>Threads That Bind Us</em>.
The event beautifully highlighted that while time may pass, the threads
that bind us—shared memories, laughter, and sisterhood—remain strong. From
heartfelt conversations to joyful reunions, every moment felt like a meaningful
stitch in the fabric of our shared story.</p>
<h4><strong><u>Stay Connected</u></strong></h4>
<p>We warmly encourage all alumnae to take part in our alumnae activities
and to continue supporting the school in achieving its educational objectives
and outcomes. Together, let us stay connected, support one another, and
inspire the next generation of Haig Girls</p>

<p>We have recently revived our Alumni Association for our old girls to actively
support the school’s vision and areas of focus, in particular the development
of character, leadership and creativity. Chaired by Ms Beverly Wee, our
group of dedicated alumna have returned to our school to give talks as
part of our Alumni Lecture Series. Dr Yeo Wei Wei and Ms Ye Shufang of
the National Art Gallery, shared their work in Arts Education at our inaugural
Alumni Lecture. Professor Debbie Ong, a former Head Prefect of Haig Girls’
School, gave an insightful speech about leadership at our Student Leaders’
Investiture. Other old girls have shared insights into their work as a
news editor, entrepreneur and leadership coach. The Creative Director for
our 60th Anniversary Musical was Ms Oniatta Effendi, who is also part of
the HGS family. Another alumna, Ms Jane Ittogi, Partner, Shook Lin &amp;
Bok LLP; Chairperson of the Singapore Art Museum, also graced our Speech
and Prize-Giving Day cum Alumni Homecoming as a Guest of Honour.</p>
<p>We are proud to have a number of Haig girls who have become educators
and school leaders and who have played an active part in moulding the future
of our nation.&nbsp; There are at least 6 Haig girls who have gone on to
become Principals of schools in Singapore.</p>
<p>As an alumna, you can give back to Haig Girls’ School in so many ways:
be a speaker at our Alumni Lecture Series, facilitate partnerships to support
our niche areas, conduct workshops for pupils in your area of expertise
or mentor our pupils.&nbsp; Inspire our pupils to be future leaders of
tomorrow and contribute towards the development of our pupils’ character,
leadership and creativity!</p>
