<h4><strong><u>HGS Alumnae Association</u></strong></h4>
<p>The HGS Alumnae Association provides a meaningful platform for alumnae
to stay connected, give back to their alma mater, and contribute to the
continued growth of Haig Girls’ School. Beyond reconnecting former classmates,
the Association plays an important role in supporting the school’s development
and inspiring future generations of Haig girls.</p>
<p>Graduation does not mark the end of one’s journey with the school; rather,
it marks the beginning of a new and lasting relationship. As alumnae, you
remain connected through shared memories, core values, and a strong sense
of belonging to the Haig Girls’ School community.</p>

<h4><strong><u>Alumnae Events</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>2024 Alumnae Gathering – <em>A Walk Down Memory Lane</em></strong>
</p>
<p>On 29 June 2024, we organised an alumnae gathering titled <em>A Walk Down Memory Lane</em>.
It was heartening to see our alumnae reconnect with old friends, reminisce
about their school days, and share their journeys since leaving Haig Girls’
School. The laughter, stories, and camaraderie were a powerful reminder
of the strong bonds that unite our community. The enthusiasm and active
participation of our alumnae contributed greatly to the success of the
event.</p>
<p><strong><em><br></em>2025 Alumnae Gathering – <em>Threads That Bind Us</em></strong>
</p>
<p>On 12 July 2025, we held our alumnae gathering <em>Threads That Bind Us</em>.
The event beautifully highlighted that while time may pass, the threads
that bind us—shared memories, laughter, and sisterhood—remain strong. From
heartfelt conversations to joyful reunions, every moment felt like a meaningful
stitch in the fabric of our shared story.</p>
<h4><strong><u>Stay Connected</u></strong></h4>
<p>We warmly encourage all alumnae to take part in our alumnae activities
and to continue supporting the school in achieving its educational objectives
and outcomes. Together, let us stay connected, support one another, and
inspire the next generation of Haig Girls.</p>
