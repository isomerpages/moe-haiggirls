<p>National Education (NE) is a key part of Character &amp; Citizenship Education
at Haig Girls’, guided by our 2E2R approach—Explicit Teaching, Experience,
Reflection, and Role-Modelling. Focused on Head, Heart, and Hands, NE nurtures
active, concerned citizens who use their knowledge and skills to serve
others. Our CCE Ambassadors lead by example through a <em>By Pupils For Pupils</em> approach,
supporting school-wide NE efforts and reinforcing key values and citizenship
dispositions.</p>
