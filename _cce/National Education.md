<p>National Education (NE) is a key part of Character &amp; Citizenship Education
at Haig Girls’, guided by our 2E2R approach—Explicit Teaching, Experience,
Reflection, and Role-Modelling. Focused on Head, Heart, and Hands, NE nurtures
active, concerned citizens who use their knowledge and skills to serve
others. Our CCE Ambassadors lead by example through a <em>By Pupils For Pupils</em> approach,
supporting school-wide NE efforts and reinforcing key values and citizenship
dispositions.</p>

<h2><strong>Social Studies</strong></h2>
<p>Social Studies helps students explore real-world issues, develop critical
thinking, and appreciate diverse perspectives. Through inquiry-based learning
and authentic learning experiences, students deepen their understanding
of Singapore’s identity and global interconnectedness. Museum-based learning
(MBL) experiences, including visits to art museums and historical sites,
further enrich this by connecting students to Singapore's cultural heritage.
These experiences complement the curriculum, encouraging reflection on
themes like multiculturalism and social change, and empowering students
to become informed, empathetic, and active citizens.</p>
