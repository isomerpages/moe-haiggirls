<p>National Education (NE) is a key part of Character &amp; Citizenship Education
at Haig Girls’, guided by our 2E2R approach—Explicit Teaching, Experience,
Reflection, and Role-Modelling. Focused on Head, Heart, and Hands, NE nurtures
active, concerned citizens who use their knowledge and skills to serve
others. Our CCE Ambassadors lead by example through a <em>By Pupils For Pupils</em> approach,
supporting school-wide NE efforts and reinforcing key values and citizenship
dispositions.</p>

<h2><strong>Social Studies</strong></h2>
<p>Social Studies helps students explore real-world issues, develop critical
thinking, and appreciate diverse perspectives. Through inquiry-based learning
and authentic learning experiences, students deepen their understanding
of Singapore’s identity and global interconnectedness. Museum-based learning
(MBL) experiences, including visits to art museums and historical sites,
further enrich this by connecting students to Singapore's cultural heritage.
These experiences complement the curriculum, encouraging reflection on
themes like multiculturalism and social change, and empowering students
to become informed, empathetic, and active citizens.</p>

<h2><strong>NE Core Events</strong></h2>
<p>Beyond formal Character and Citizenship Education lessons, the four National
Education (NE) Commemorative Days – Total Defence Day, International Friendship
Day, Racial Harmony Day, and National Day – form key student development
experiences. These events are anchored in defining moments of Singapore’s
history and provide meaningful opportunities for students to learn, reflect,
and deepen their sense of identity and belonging. Through these commemorations,
students are encouraged to apply their learning and play an active role
in shaping a caring, cohesive, and resilient society.</p>
<h2><strong>Total Defence Day</strong></h2>
<p>Total Defence Day is commemorated to highlight the importance of unity
and resilience in the face of challenges. Students are immersed in a journey
to reflect on Singapore’s past, consider its future, and examine the role
they can play in shaping what lies ahead. Through classroom discussions
and hands-on activities, students explore how Singapore responds to crises
and learn that keeping the nation safe is a shared responsibility. These
experiences reinforce the importance of working together and being prepared
for challenges. In the lead-up to the commemoration, students are also
provided with resources such as Kindsville Times and A-OK! to encourage
meaningful conversations at home about resilience and preparedness.</p>

<h2><strong>International Friendship Day</strong></h2>
<p>International Friendship Day (IFD) is commemorated at HGS to highlight
the importance of international cooperation and Singapore’s global engagement.
Through activities such as READ@HGS, a Dondang Sayang performance, and
CCE (FTGP) IFD lessons, students deepen their understanding of Singapore’s
regional ties, develop cross-cultural competencies, and appreciate the
spirit of collaboration. Recess activities further provide opportunities
for students to explore the cultures of ASEAN member states, strengthening
awareness of Singapore’s place in the region. Collectively, these experiences
cultivate a spirit of friendship, openness, and respect for cultural diversity,
preparing students to engage confidently in an increasingly interconnected
world.</p>
<p>As part of our efforts to promote foreigner-local integration, the school
designs experiences to foster mutual understanding and appreciation among
students from different cultural backgrounds. In 2025, students visited
Kampong Buangkok to learn more about Singapore’s history and heritage,
encouraging meaningful interactions between local and ISPR students, building
mutual trust, and deepening their appreciation for the country they now
call home, while promoting the spirit of friendship and collaboration.</p>

<h2><strong>Racial Harmony Day</strong></h2>
<p>Theme: Our People, Our Tapestry</p>
<p>We commemorate Racial Harmony Day (RHD) each year on 21 July to mark the
anniversary of the 1964 race riots. On this day, students reflect on and
celebrate Singapore’s harmonious society, built on a rich diversity of
cultures and the collective effort to promote social cohesion. Through
various activities, students engage with peers from different races and
religions, reinforcing the message that all people in Singapore are treated
equally regardless of race or religion. These experiences encourage appreciation
for the diverse cultures that make up our nation.</p>

<h2><br><strong>National Day</strong></h2>
<p>Schools commemorate National Day on 8 August to mark Singapore’s independence
in 1965. At Haig Girls, we celebrate this milestone by instilling the values
of active citizenship and gratitude in our students. As part of the <strong>Bags of Blessings</strong> initiative,
students engage in outreach to various community groups, learning the importance
of giving back. <em>Read more </em><a href="https://www.haiggirls.moe.edu.sg/via-bobs-er/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">here</a><em>.</em> Additionally,
our Parents Support Group organizes a charity book drive, with proceeds
supporting students in need.</p>
<p>A key part of the Primary 5 student development experience is the <strong>NE Show</strong>,
where all Primary 5 students are invited to attend this preview of the
National Day Parade, deepening their connection to the nation’s heritage
and values.</p>
<p>Students look forward to the NE commemorative events, which help to deepen
students' understanding of Singapore's history, values, and their role
as active citizens. Through these events, students develop a strong sense
of national identity, resilience, and an appreciation for Singapore's diverse
and harmonious society.</p>
