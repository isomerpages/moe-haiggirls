<h2><strong>CCE @ HGS</strong></h2>
<p>At Haig Girls’, we offer a holistic Character and Citizenship Education
(CCE) curriculum designed to meet the diverse needs of our students. This
curriculum includes mandatory CCE lessons during Form Teacher Guidance
Period - CCE (FTGP), CCE Mother Tongue Language lessons - CCE (MTL), Assembly
sessions, key student development experiences and school-based initiatives.
Our R3ICH values—Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Compassion,
and Humility—are integrated throughout these experiences, guiding students
to internalise and embody these values.</p>
<p>We follow a 2E2R approach (Explicit Teaching, Experiential Learning, Role
Modeling, and Reflection), combining structured lessons, hands-on experiences,
and role-modelling to foster active learning, reflection, and critical
thinking. Through serviceto the school and community, leadership roles,
CCAs, and project work, students apply their values in meaningful ways,
contributing to others and collaborating with peers. Our programmes focus
on nurturing not only the minds, but also the hearts and hands of every
Haig girl.</p>
