<p>At HGS, we believe that every student has the potential to be a leader
of character, demonstrating our school values and leadership attributes.
To nurture this potential, the Student Leadership Framework has been established
to guide students in their leadership journey.</p>
<p>
<br>Rooted in HGS’ vision of <em>“Empowering every Haig Girl to Learn and Lead, in Service of Others,”</em> the
framework is represented by four concentric circles. The inner circles
highlight our core values and leadership attributes, while the outer circles
illustrate the platforms and approaches that provide students with opportunities
to develop and refine their leadership skills.</p>

<p>The Student Leadership Framework is designed to develop leadership in
every Haig Girl through four concentric circles:</p>
<h4><strong>Inner Circle: School Values (R<sup>3</sup>ICH)</strong></h4>
<p>This circle represents our core values: Responsibility, Resilience, Respect,
Integrity, Compassion, and Humility (R3ICH), which are foundational to
leadership development.</p>
<h4><strong>Second Circle: Leadership Attributes</strong></h4>
<p>This circle focuses on key leadership qualities:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Leads by Example</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Takes Initiative</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Serves with Humility</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Influences Others Positively</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Third Circle: Leadership Platforms</strong></h4>
<p>This circle represents authentic leadership roles such as CCA Leaders,
Class Leaders, Ambassadors, and Prefects, giving students real opportunities
to lead.</p>
<h4><strong>Outermost Circle: The 2E2R Approach</strong></h4>
<p>The outer circle illustrates the 2E2R approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Experience</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explicit Teaching</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reflection</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Role-modelling</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach helps develop leadership through teaching, practical experiences,
reflection, and peer evaluation, with opportunities for students to lead
events like the TKSS Junior Leadership Symposium and HGS Open House. We
also provide affirmation through events such as the Student Leaders' Investiture
and Prize-Giving Day, celebrating both achievements and the character of
our students.</p>
