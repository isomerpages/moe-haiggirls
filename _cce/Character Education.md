<h2><strong>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) Lessons</strong></h2>
<p>CCE Lessons in Haig Girls’ are enacted through CCE Form Teacher Guidance
Period (FTGP) and CCE Mother Tongue Language (MTL). At Lower Primary, CCE
Lessons also include the Programme for Active Learning (PAL). CCE (FTGP),
CCE (MTL) and PAL are guided by one syllabus and the CCE Learning Outcomes
are realised in different ways. Lessons in CCE (FTGP) and CCE (MTL) use
stories, scenarios, songs and games, while PAL creates opportunities for
students to apply their learning through the domains of Sports &amp; Games,
Outdoor Education, Visual Arts, and Performing Arts.</p>
<h2><strong>CCE Form Teacher Guidance Period - CCE(FTGP)</strong></h2>
<p>The Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) fosters quality interactions between
form teachers and students, focusing on building character and developing
social-emotional competencies. Through explicit teaching of these skills,
students gain a strong foundation for more complex discussions in later
years. FTGP also emphasises citizenship dispositions, promoting inter-ethnic
understanding and appreciation for diverse cultures in a multicultural
setting.</p>
<h2><strong>CCE Mother Tongue Language - CCE(MTL)</strong></h2>
<p>CCE (MTL) is taught through the Mother Tongue Languages (MTLs) to enhance
students' language skills while inculcating values. Cultural stories, proverbs,
and songs used in the MTL lessons reflect key values and help students
connect with the content, fostering self-reflection. These stories highlight
life experiences, encouraging understanding of identity, relationships,
and choices. They also deepen appreciation for cultural heritage and promote
respect for diverse cultures, races, and religions. For Non-Tamil Language
(NTIL) students and students exempted from Mother Tongue language, CCE
is taught in English, ensuring access to these lessons.</p>

<h2><strong>Programme for Active Learning (PAL)</strong></h2>
<p>The Programme for Active Learning (PAL) is a key component of the curriculum
for Primary 1 and 2 students, offering hands-on, experiential learning
across four domains: Sports &amp; Games, Outdoor Education, Visual Arts,
and Performing Arts. PAL aims to help students discover new interests,
develop social-emotional competencies, and build character. With a focus
on social and emotional learning (SEL), creative learning, and fun, the
programme provides opportunities for students to engage in meaningful experiences,
create, and enjoy the process of learning.</p>

<h2><strong>Values Curriculum</strong></h2>
<p>At Haig Girls’ School, our six core values—Respect, Responsibility, Resilience,
Integrity, Compassion, and Humility—form the foundation of our values curriculum.
These values are explicitly taught and reinforced through various platforms,
helping students build character and guide their daily choices. To bring
these values to life in relatable ways, we introduced the Amberinas—our
in-house mascots who embody each value. Through classroom experiences and
strong partnerships with parents, we aim to nurture Haig girls who grow
to be respectful, responsible, and compassionate individuals who lead and
serve with heart, both in school and beyond.</p>
