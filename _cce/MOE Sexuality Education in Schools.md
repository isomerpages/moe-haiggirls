<h2>MOE Sexuality Education in Schools - Haig Girls' School</h2>
<p>1.&nbsp; Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools aims to enable students
to understand the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience
as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships with others,
including those with members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed
and responsible decisions on sexuality matters. SEd is premised on the
importance of the family as the basic unit of society. This means encouraging
healthy, heterosexual marriages and stable nuclear family units with extended
family support. The teaching and learning of SEd is based on respect for
the values and beliefs of the different ethnic and religious communities
in Singapore on sexuality issues.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <strong>Goals</strong> of Sexuality Education are:</p>
<p>(a) Support students in managing their physiological, social and emotional
changes as they grow up and develop safe and healthy relationships.</p>
<p>b) Guide students to make wise, informed and responsible decisions on
sexuality matters.</p>
<p>(c) Help students develop a moral compass and respect for themselves and
others by having positive mainstream values and attitudes about sexuality
that are premised on the family as the basic unit of society.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;The <strong>Key Messages</strong> of Sexuality Education are:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;Love and respect yourself as you love and respect others;</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;Build positive relationships based on love and respect (which
are the foundation for strong families);</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;Make responsible decisions for yourself, your family and society;
and</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp;Abstinence before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV
and unintended pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved
ones.</p>

<p><strong>Overview of Haig Girls’</strong>  <strong>School’s</strong>  <strong>Sexuality Education Programme for 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Sexuality Education is delivered in a holistic manner through
the school curriculum. The content for Sexuality Education is grouped into
five main themes: Human Development, Interpersonal Relationships, Sexual
Health, Sexual Behaviour, and, Culture, Society and Law. You may click
<a href="https://go.gov.sg/moe-sexuality-education-scope" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>for more information on the scope of Sexuality Education in the
school curriculum.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;The subjects that incorporate topics on sexuality include:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;Science</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)</p>
<p><strong>Sexuality Education Lessons</strong>:</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; The upper primary years mark the onset of puberty. With better
nutrition and improved health care, children are reaching puberty at a
younger age and have to grapple with physical, emotional and psychological
changes in themselves. The implication is that our children are becoming
biologically ready for sexual activity sooner without necessarily having
the corresponding cognitive or emotional maturity to modulate their behaviours.
Furthermore, our young are also exposed to a wide range of influences that
could endanger health and undermine the integrity of the family. Our students
require close guidance so that they can respond with discernment to the
sexual messages in the media and other sources.</p>
<p>7. Sexuality Education (SEd) lessons are taught as part of CCE (FTGP)
at Primary 5 and 6. Through these lessons, students will learn healthy
ways to manage the physiological, social and emotional changes in their
growing years. They learn to build healthy and rewarding relationships
with others, including those with members of the opposite sex. Students
are also guided to make wise, informed and responsible decisions to keep
themselves safe from sexuality-related risks.</p>
