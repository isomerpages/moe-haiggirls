<h2>Gamelan Ensemble</h2>
<p>The Gamelan Ensemble nurtures students’ appreciation for music by immersing
them in the rich traditions of Javanese Gamelan and Singapore’s evolving
cultural landscape. Through exposure to a diverse repertoire, students
develop musicality, discipline, teamwork, and a strong sense of cultural
identity within the rich, rhythmic soundscape of Gamelan.</p>
<p>Students learn the unique striking techniques required to play a range
of Gamelan instruments — including metallophones, gongs, xylophones, and
drums. Playing Gamelan is inherently collaborative, requiring deep listening,
coordination, and shared responsibility, as each instrument contributes
a vital layer to the ensemble’s interlocking rhythms and melodies.</p>
<p>Beyond musicianship, the Ensemble fosters leadership development. Senior
members take on active roles in student-led outreach activities, including
mentoring junior members, planning events, and promoting cultural appreciation
within and beyond the school community.</p>
<p>In 2024, the Ensemble was awarded the Certificate of Distinction at the
Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation, a testament to the students’
dedication and passion for their craft. In July 2025, the Ensemble collaborated
with Meridian Secondary School’s Angklung Ensemble to perform at the Singapore
Youth Festival (SYF) 2025 Celebrations – Kaleidoscope, held at Esplanade
– Theatres on the Bay.</p>
