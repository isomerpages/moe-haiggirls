<h3>Bowling</h3>
<p>Bowling CCA has been part of Haig Girls’ School for more than ten years.
It is a lifelong skill that promotes focus, coordination, and perseverance.
Beyond being an enjoyable recreational activity, bowling also nurtures
teamwork and sportsmanship as students learn to compete both individually
and in teams.</p>
<p>The school engages qualified coaches, manages lane bookings, and arranges
transport to training and competition venues. All related costs are fully
covered by the school to ensure our students have the best possible learning
and training experience.</p>
<p>Our bowlers have performed well at the National School Games over the
years, with many medal winners and a 3rd place finish in the Senior Girls’
Division in 2024, and 4th place overall in Senior Divisional Title in 2025.
Many of our alumni have continued their passion for bowling in their secondary
schools and beyond.</p>
