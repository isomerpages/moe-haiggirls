<h3>Choir</h3>
<p>The Choir offers students a joyful and enriching environment to express
themselves through singing, while nurturing their confidence, character,
and sense of teamwork. Rooted in the principles of Social and Emotional
Learning (SEL) and 21st Century Competencies (21CC), the Choir cultivates
values such as responsibility, discipline, and collaboration.</p>
<p>By coming together for regular rehearsals, members get to build their
singing skills — like voice projection and singing as a group—while trying
out all kinds of music. This fun and varied experience helps them grow
as musicians and enjoy the world of performing arts even more.</p>
<p>Beyond musical growth, members are also given opportunities to develop
leadership skills. Student leaders guide their peers during training sessions
and contribute to student-led events and outreach performances, gaining
valuable experience in initiative and teamwork.</p>
<p>The Choir actively participates in school celebrations and special events.
In 2024, the members proudly represented Haig Girls' School at the biennial
Singapore Youth Festival (SYF). In previous years, they also performed
at community events such as the Joo Chiat Children’s Day Carnival 2022,
graced by Minister Tan See Leng.</p>
<p>Brought together by their love for music, the HGS Choir continues to shine
in every performance, growing into confident singers and kind-hearted individuals
who spread the joy of music to those around them.</p>
