<h3>Chinese Dance</h3>
<p>Chinese Dance at HGS provides students with a rich platform to develop
confidence, discipline, and leadership through the art of dance. By taking
on roles such as dance leaders, choreographers, and supporters, members
develop responsibility, strengthen teamwork, and build a strong sense of
camaraderie. The CCA emphasizes the development of fundamental dance techniques,
focusing on grace, flexibility, coordination, and balance. Students are
introduced to both traditional and contemporary Chinese dance forms, deepening
their appreciation for cultural heritage.</p>
<p>Through regular practices and peer-led choreography, students strengthen
their techniques, express creativity, and support one another in a student-led
and student - centered environment. Collaboration and mutual respect are
key pillars, as members work together during rehearsals and performances.</p>
<p>Students also have opportunities to showcase their talent at various platforms,
including the 2024 Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation, the
SYF 2024 Dance Extravaganza at Gardens by the Bay, and the School’s Prize
Giving Day. These experiences build confidence and performance skills in
real-world settings.</p>
<p>The Chinese Dance team has achieved an impressive track record, consistently
earning Certificates of Distinction at the past ten SYF Arts Presentations
- reflecting the dedication, discipline, and excellence of our students.</p>
