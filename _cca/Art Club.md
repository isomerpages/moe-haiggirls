<h3>Art Club</h3>
<p>The Art Club at Haig Girls’ School offers a vibrant space for students
to explore creativity and develop a deeper appreciation for visual art.
Through hands-on experiences with diverse media, techniques, and both local
and global art forms, students discover artistic traditions and Singapore’s
rich cultural heritage.</p>
<p>The programme builds creative confidence through individual projects and
collaborative artworks that foster teamwork, communication, and inclusivity.
Students apply critical thinking as they plan, reflect, and make thoughtful
artistic choices.</p>
<p>Aligned with 21st Century Competencies (E21CC), the Art Club nurtures
self-management, empathy, and responsible decision-making. Through artmaking
and peer feedback, students express themselves, value diverse perspectives,
and grow through creative challenges.</p>
<p>Participation in external competitions builds resilience, confidence,
and connection with the wider art community. By balancing individual and
group artmaking, students sharpen artistic skills and learn to use art
as a tool for expression, collaboration, and meaningful engagement.</p>
