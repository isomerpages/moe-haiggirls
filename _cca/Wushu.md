<h2>Wushu</h2>
<p>Wushu provides students with a holistic education that nurtures resilience,
discipline, teamwork and sportsmanship. Students engage in structured lessons
that build character, perseverance and a growth mindset, preparing them
for life challenges.</p>
<p>Wushu not only strengthens their physical health but also shapes their
character. During CCA, students learn to care for their weapons and maintain
training equipment, thus instilling a sense of responsibility. Though training
can be tiring, they build resilience and tenacity as they spur one another
on. As they work together with their peers, they learn the value of teamwork
and forge friendships for life.</p>
<p>Our Wushu students have the opportunities to perform in school events
such as Chinese New Year Celebration, Speech Day and CCA Carnival. Selected
students also participate in National School Games Wushu Championships
and have consistently proven themselves on the National platform.</p>
