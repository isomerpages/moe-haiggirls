<h3><strong>Football</strong></h3>
<p>Football is a growing sport among girls in Singapore, and at Haig Girls’
School, it continues to attract strong interest and enthusiasm. Through
commitment, teamwork, and resilience, our Football Team has consistently
achieved Top 4 placings in the National School Games Football Championships
every year since 2010.</p>
<p>Students who are not part of the school team also have opportunities to
take part in external competitions. At the end of each year, all members
participate in the FAS Soccer Festival, a friendly competition organised
by Football Association of Singapore, where they can apply what they have
learnt during CCA and gain more exposure to the beautiful game.</p>
<p>The CCA is coached by dedicated teachers who guide students in developing
their skills, teamwork, resilience, and sportsmanship through the sport.</p>
