<h3><strong>Netball</strong></h3>
<p>Netball is a dynamic sport that demands stamina, skill, accuracy, and
strong teamwork. At HGS, we believe Netball is not only a platform to nurture
athletic ability but also a meaningful avenue to instill our core school
values and foster good sportsmanship. Most importantly, we hope our students
will build lifelong friendships through their shared passion for the game.</p>
<p>All Netball CCA members are introduced to the foundational rules and concepts
of the game. Training sessions include drills and activities that strengthen
fundamental movement skills and game awareness. Students who display strong
potential are invited to join the D3T2 Training Squad, where they undergo
intensive training twice weekly (on Mondays and Fridays) to further sharpen
their skills and competitiveness.</p>
<p>Beyond court-based learning, students also grow through experiential opportunities
that support the development of 21st Century Competencies. Netballers regularly
take part in friendly matches, sports carnivals, and the National School
Games Netball Zonal Championships. At the heart of our Netball CCA is the
belief that every training, every match, and every moment on the court
contributes to shaping confident, responsible, and passionate individuals
both as athletes and as members of the school community.</p>
