<h3>Badminton</h3>
<p>The Badminton CCA provides our students with opportunities to develop
their skills and passion for the sport in a supportive and stimulating
environment. Beyond learning a variety of badminton techniques, footwork,
and game strategies, our members also work on improving their physical
fitness, agility, and coordination through regular training sessions.</p>
<p>Through the sport, students learn resilience and perseverance as they
strive to refine their skills and overcome challenges on the court. The
CCA also serves as a platform for character development, where students
cultivate values such as discipline, teamwork, sportsmanship, and mental
endurance.</p>
<p>In alignment with the Haig Girls’ School values and the 21st Century Competencies
(E21CC), our players develop confidence, self-management, and social-emotional
skills through both training and competitions. They learn to communicate
effectively, think critically, and collaborate with others.</p>
<p>Leadership is also an integral part of our programme. Our girls are given
opportunities to take ownership of their CCA experience by leading warm-up
activities, organising drills, and planning match fixtures for their peers.
These experiences nurture responsibility and a sense of camaraderie within
the team.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the Badminton CCA aims to develop not only skilled and confident
players, but also well-rounded individuals who embody the school’s values
and the spirit of fair play, determination, and teamwork both on and off
the court.</p>
