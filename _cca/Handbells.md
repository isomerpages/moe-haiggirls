<h3>Handbells Ensemble</h3>
<p>The Handbells Ensemble offers students a unique opportunity to create
beautiful music through the art of handbell ringing. Our dedicated ringers
work together as one coordinated unit, developing not only their musical
abilities but also essential life skills such as teamwork, concentration,
and discipline.</p>
<p>Each ringer is responsible for specific notes, and the ensemble comes
alive when everyone plays their part in perfect harmony. Through regular
practice sessions, our students perfect their ringing techniques, learn
music theory, and pick up essential performance skills. The CCA welcomes
both beginners and experienced musicians who share a passion for creating
melodious sounds.</p>
<p>Our ensemble regularly performs at various school and community events,
bringing the unique sound of handbells to diverse audiences. We have had
the honour of performing at the Marine Parade Chinese New Year Dinner 2023,
Marine Parade National Day Dinner 2019, and our school's Prize Giving Day
2023. Beyond local performances, our students have also represented the
school at the 2022 Hong Kong International Handbell Olympics, where they
earned a Silver award. The ensemble's journey has helped our members grow
in confidence and musical ability while fostering lasting friendships.</p>
