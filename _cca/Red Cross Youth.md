<h3>Red Cross Youth</h3>
<p>As a Uniformed Group, the Red Cross Youth instills the values of self-discipline,
order and teamwork in our Red Cross links. Contrary to a popular belief
that Red Cross Youth only teaches First Aid, we also expose our links to
activities and lessons such as Disaster Management, Basic Outdoor Activities
and Red Cross Knowledge. Our links also participate in various activities
at Red Cross Headquarters as well as&nbsp; competitions such as World Red
Cross Day and First Aid Championships.</p>
<p>Our links are also exposed to real-life situations and have the opportunity
to put their skills learned in the Red Cross to use. With "Humanity in
Our Hands" as the guiding motto of RCY, our primary goal is to mould our
links into servant leaders who contribute to the community by applying
the skills which they have acquired through Red Cross activities.</p>
