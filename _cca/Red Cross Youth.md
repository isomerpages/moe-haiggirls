### Red Cross Youth

As a Uniformed Group, the Red Cross Youth instills the values of self-discipline, order and teamwork in our Red Cross links. Contrary to a popular belief that Red Cross Youth only teaches First Aid, we also expose our links to activities and lessons such as Disaster Management, Basic Outdoor Activities and Red Cross Knowledge. Our links also participate in various activities at Red Cross Headquarters as well as  competitions such as World Red Cross Day and First Aid Championships.

Our links are also exposed to real-life situations and have the opportunity to put their skills learned in the Red Cross to use. With "Humanity in Our Hands" as the guiding motto of RCY, our primary goal is to mould our links into servant leaders who contribute to the community by applying the skills which they have acquired through Red Cross activities.
