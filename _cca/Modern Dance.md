<h3>Modern Dance</h3>
<p>Modern Dance offers students a vibrant platform to explore their passion
for movement while developing confidence, discipline, and teamwork. Through
structured training and performance opportunities, students build a strong
foundation in dance techniques and stage presence, nurturing both artistic
expression and personal growth.</p>
<p>Our programme emphasises creativity, collaboration, and leadership. Students
take ownership of their learning through student-led choreography and events,
guiding one another through the creative process. These experiences not
only enhance their dance skills but also help them grow as empathetic and
responsible leaders.</p>
<p>Modern Dance members gain valuable performance experience through a range
of platforms, including public showcases such as community events at Joo
Chiat Community Club. These opportunities enable students to share their
artistry beyond the school setting, develop greater confidence and build
connections with the wider community.</p>
<p>Working in groups to co-create dance pieces, students sharpen their problem-solving
abilities in a supportive and inclusive environment. Along the way, they
develop essential 21st Century Competencies such as self-awareness, self-management,
effective communication, and teamworkâ€”skills that prepare them for success
both on and off the stage.</p>
