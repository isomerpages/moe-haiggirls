<h3>Drama Club</h3>
<p>Drama Club is a lively and exciting Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) in Haig
Girls’ School where students get to explore the world of acting and performing.
They learn how to work together to put on a play and understand what goes
into making a performance come to life. This includes using their voices
clearly and effectively, showing emotions with their faces and bodies,
and understanding how lights and sounds can make a scene more powerful.
Every girl is encouraged to step out of her comfort zone, express herself
confidently, and grow in both skill and self-assurance.</p>
<p>Our girls take part in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation
Drama (Primary) every two years and also perform for school events. During
these performances, students work closely with their teachers and Drama
instructor to put together a captivating and engaging showcase. They also
learn to create props and costumes, and help out backstage. These hands-on
experiences are a great way for them to build confidence, practise leadership,
and improve their planning and teamwork skills.</p>
<p>Drama Club CCA aims to cultivate creativity, the ability to express oneself
and a lifelong passion for the arts in our girls.</p>
