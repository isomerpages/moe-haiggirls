<p>The CCA journey for our Haig Girls begins at the end of Primary 2, when
they attend a CCA Carnival to explore the different CCAs offered in HGS.
At the carnival, our Haig Girls will have opportunities to watch performances
by the Performing Arts CCAs, have hands-on experience and engage in conversations
with CCA leaders/teachers at the CCA booths. After which, the P2s will
select the CCA of their choice and begin their 4-year CCA adventure in
Primary 3. In this journey, they will forge new friendships, learn new
skills, take up leadership roles and may represent the school in external
competitions. Through this, we endeavour for every Haig Girl to develop
valuable 21st Century Competencies and values, and grow to lead self and
lead others.</p>
