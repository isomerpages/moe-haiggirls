<h3><strong>Science Club</strong></h3>
<p>Science Club is a vibrant, hands-on space where students from Primary
3 to Primary 6 explore science through exciting activities and teamwork.
The club aims to make the learning of science enjoyable and meaningful
for everyone.</p>
<p>Members participate in engaging weekly sessions featuring hands-on experiments
and science enrichment programmes. Highlights include the World of Wonders
@ Recess, where students across the school explored interactive science
experiments, and a Robotics Workshop, where members built and programmed
robots while picking up valuable tech skills.</p>
<p>The club also hosted fun STEM challenges such as the Egg Drop, where students
designed containers to protect eggs from high-impact falls, and the Tallest
Straw Tower, a race to build the highest freestanding structure using only
straws and tape. The Paper Airplane Challenge tested members' creativity
and understanding of flight dynamics.</p>
<p>Through these experiences, Science Club members learn by doing, build
confidence, and discover the joy of science in everyday life.</p>
