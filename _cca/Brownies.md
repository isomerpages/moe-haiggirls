<h2>Brownies</h2>
<p>Brownies is a Uniformed Group under Girl Guides Singapore (GGS) that provides
a fun and supportive environment for girls to explore their interests,
build confidence, and develop essential life skills.</p>
<p>At the heart of the Brownie programme is the 5-Point Programme, which
focuses on five key areas of development: Personal Social Development,
Home, Outdoor, Community and International. This helps Brownies discover
their strengths, develop new skills and reach their fullest potential while
fostering a sense of responsibility and service.</p>
<p>Teamwork plays an important role in a Brownie’s experience. The girls
work in small groups called Sixes, where they learn cooperation, leadership
and the importance of supporting one another. They also uphold the Brownie
Promise and Law, which emphasise values such as kindness, respect and responsibility.</p>
<p>Brownies engage in a variety of activities, including creative projects
like arts and crafts, as well as learning valuable life skills, including
needlework, problem-solving and leadership. Earning badges is a key part
of the experience, with each badge representing a new skill or achievement
in areas like science, the environment and community service.</p>
<p>Girls are also given opportunities to interact with brownies and girl
guides from other schools through special events such as World Thinking
Day and East Division Day. These events promote unity, friendship and cultural
exchange, which allow the girls to celebrate the values of the Guiding
Movement together.</p>
