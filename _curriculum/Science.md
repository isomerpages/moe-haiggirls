In Haig Girls’ School, we believe that our girls can think, learn, achieve & excel. 

We seek to nurture the student as an inquirer, who enjoy science and value science as an important tool in helping them explore their natural and physical world. The inculcation of the spirit of scientific inquiry are in three domains - (a) Knowledge, Understanding and Application, (b) Skills and Process and (c) Ethics and Attitudes.
  
Our Science curriculum also aligns with itself our school goals with the ultimate goal of developing our pupils to be self-directed, confident and adaptive 21st century learners.

## Teaching And Learning Through Inquiry
The teaching and learning approaches centre around the student as an inquirer. The teacher is the leader of inquiry in the science classroom who creates a learning environment that will encourage and challenge students to develop their sense of inquiry.  

Our teachers use a variety of teaching strategies to facilitate the inquiry process with the aim to engage students in meaningful learning experiences and cultivate their interest and curiosity in science. 

**Hands-On Learning**    
To get pupils engaged and excited about what they are studying, hands-on learning help pupils make connections from concrete to abstract. The hands-on learning experiences is also extended to be situated in realistic contexts so that students can make connections with their own lives and the environment in which they live.

**Teaching through the Arts Programme: Drama in Science**   
Drama in Science aims to stimulate our pupils’ interest and enjoyment towards learning Science. Some drama strategies such as role playing, tableau and diagrammatic drawing are introduced to develop pupils’ scientific conceptual understanding.

**Knowledge Building : Idea Centred Classroom** 

At Haig Girls’ School, we aim to develop and nurture our students to think and act like young scientists. We adopt a knowledge building culture to create an idea centred classroom where students use their own ideas and curiosity to drive their learning. Students will co-create and test their own theories from observations made of scientific phenomena.

Through teamwork and investigation, students will prove or improve their theories. This will help them develop and enhance their scientific literacy whilst developing 21st century competencies and instilling positive attitudes of lifelong learning.

**Holistic Assessment to Support Learning**   
Assessment is integral to the learning process.  
  
In Primary 3, Science busking is a performance task to engage our pupils in applying Science concepts to build a boat that could float. Excited and inspired, the girls demonstrated creativity in the boats that they had made. They also developed their abilities to think critically and apply their process skills and Science knowledge.  
  
Other assessment modes to provide useful information that supports student’s learning and holistic development include journaling, peer and self-assessment, use of checklist and rubrics, practical work, use of white board (APRICOT) and traffic lights during lessons.

**Science D3T2 (Discover, Develop & Dedicate your Talent Time)**    
Science D3T2, a school-based talent development programme, aims to develop scientific inquiry process skills and nurture 21st century competencies such as resilience and resourcefulness, critical and inventive thinking, and effective communication skills. Through collaborative learning, pupils practise scientific thinking and reasoning, develop confidence and independence in scientific inquiry and habits, attitudes and dispositions.

The school has embarked on the E2K Science Programme Singapore, a Science enrichment programme specially developed by the Ministry of Education (Gifted Education Branch) for upper primary students.

**Science Games@Recess**   
To encourage learning beyond classroom, Science Games@Recess takes place during recesses every Friday at the foyer with the help of parent volunteers and Science ambassadors. Pupils from all levels have fun exploring Science concepts through games. 

  

This programme aims to stimulate pupils’ interest in Science and develop their inquiry skills as they engage in exploratory learning. They learn to construct their understanding about Science concepts and connect Science to their everyday lives.
