Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)&nbsp; is at the heart of education in Singapore. Through CCE, students learn values, social-emotional competencies, and develop character and citizenship dispositions that enable them to grow holistically and learn for life. The CCE 2021 curriculum provides an integrated approach to addressing our students’ development of values, character, social-emotional well-being, and citizenship dispositions in a coherent and holistic way.&nbsp;

To help our students adapt to disruptions in a rapidly evolving world, the knowledge, skills, and values taught in CCE are current and relevant. The CCE 2021 curriculum also helps our students navigate the realities of their time.

At Haig Girls’, we emphasise the importance of the character and citizenship development of every student. Our student-centric and values-driven approach helps nurture every student to become a leader of character and a concerned citizen. We do so through reinforcing the I4Cs (Integrity, Concern, Commitment and Cooperation) and 3S1W (Sense of Belonging, Sense of Reality, Sense of Hope and the Will to act) in their experiences.

Values are explicitly taught and infused throughout the curriculum and through role-modelling, reflection and experience. Service to the school and community, leadership roles and responsibilities, CCAs and project work are important experiences that we seek to give our students, so that they can live out the school values in the process of serving others and working with one another. Our programmes not only focus on the head but also the heart and hands of every Haig Girl.
