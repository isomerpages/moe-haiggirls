Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)&nbsp; is at the heart of education in Singapore. Through CCE, students learn values, social-emotional competencies, and develop character and citizenship dispositions that enable them to grow holistically and learn for life. The CCE 2021 curriculum provides an integrated approach to addressing our students’ development of values, character, social-emotional well-being, and citizenship dispositions in a coherent and holistic way.&nbsp;

To help our students adapt to disruptions in a rapidly evolving world, the knowledge, skills, and values taught in CCE are current and relevant. The CCE 2021 curriculum also helps our students navigate the realities of their time.

At Haig Girls’, we emphasise the importance of the character and citizenship development of every student. Our student-centric and values-driven approach helps nurture every student to become a leader of character and a concerned citizen. We do so through reinforcing the I4Cs (Integrity, Concern, Commitment and Cooperation) and 3S1W (Sense of Belonging, Sense of Reality, Sense of Hope and the Will to act) in their experiences.

Values are explicitly taught and infused throughout the curriculum and through role-modelling, reflection and experience. Service to the school and community, leadership roles and responsibilities, CCAs and project work are important experiences that we seek to give our students, so that they can live out the school values in the process of serving others and working with one another. Our programmes not only focus on the head but also the heart and hands of every Haig Girl.

Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) Lessons

CCE Lessons in Haig Girls are enacted through CCE Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) and CCE Mother Tongue Language (MTL). At Lower Primary, CCE Lessons also include the Programme for Active Learning (PAL). CCE (FTGP), CCE (MTL) and PAL are guided by one syllabus and the CCE Learning Outcomes are realised in different ways. Lessons in CCE (FTGP) and CCE (MTL) use stories, scenarios, songs and games, while PAL creates opportunities for students to apply their learning through the domains of Sports &amp; Games, Outdoor Education, Visual Arts, and Performing Arts.&nbsp;

##### CCE Form Teacher Guidance Period - CCE(FTGP)

Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) provides quality interaction time between form teachers and students, and equip students with social and emotional competencies. We hope for our students to have a strong foundation to build character, develop social-emotional competencies and citizenship dispositions. There is emphasis on explicit teaching of social-emotional competencies in CCE (FTGP) as the basic skills taught at the Primary levels lay the foundation for more complex conversations and discussions at the Secondary levels and beyond. Topics related to developing citizenship dispositions are also taught in CCE (FTGP) to foster inter-ethnic understanding and appreciation for one another’s culture in a multicultural classroom setting.

Sexuality Education (SEd) lessons are taught as part of CCE (FTGP) at Primary 5 and 6. In SEd, students learn to understand the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience as they mature. For example, they learn about developing healthy and rewarding relationships, including those with members of the opposite sex, and to make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters.

Education and Career Guidance (ECG) experiences in Haig Girls’ provide an opportunity for our students&nbsp; to build their self-awareness and knowledge of the different education and career pathways available. Through the CCE (FTGP) curriculum, students get to discover their own values, strengths, interests and skills in order to be better equipped to make informed choices when selecting schools for secondary and tertiary education and thereafter their career. Students also get to attend secondary school and careers talks.&nbsp;

##### CCE Mother Tongue Language - CCE(MTL)

CCE (known as Civics and Moral Education (CME) prior to 2014) is taught in the Mother Tongue Languages as they hold a rich source of knowledge for the transmission of values. The teaching of CCE in the MTLs also provides additional exposure time so as to improve students’ competency in Chinese, Malay and Tamil. CCE (MTL) lessons share common unit titles with variations in the lesson titles based on the cultural stories, practices, proverbs or songs selected by each language. Cultural stories are used in the teaching of CCE as:&nbsp;

• Values can be rather abstract for young children. Cultural stories help children to reflect upon themselves through the lives of the characters and make sense of experiences of life. Thus, children would strive to emulate the values of the characters they read about.

• Cultural stories are rich in life experiences with the use of people or animals in scenarios to bring out issues of identity, relationships and choices.

• Cultural stories contain the culture, heritage and language of a community. Children would gain a deeper understanding of their cultural heritage, which comprises the traditions, rituals, crafts, expressions, knowledge and skills that we practise and pass on from generation to generation.

• Stories from other cultures help develop and promote better understanding, respect, appreciation, and a more positive outlook towards people from different lands, races and religions.

##### Programme for Active Learning (PAL)

PAL is an integral part of the curriculum for all Primary 1 and 2 students. The programme offers hands-on and experiential learning through the following four domains: Sports &amp; Games, Outdoor Education, Visual Arts, and Performing Arts. PAL provides opportunities for students to discover new interests, develop character and enables them to develop social-emotional competencies. The five characteristics of PAL are as follow:

1.  Focus on Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) and values;
    
2.  Be driven by experiential learning;
    
3.  Encompass learning in creative ways;
    
4.  Provide opportunities to create; and
    
5.  Engage in fun and enjoyable learning.
    
		
Learning To Learn
-----------------

We, the pupils of Haig Girls’ School believe that we can think, learn, achieve and excel.  
We believe that we will be gracious, self-disciplined and responsible citizens.  
~ HGS Pupil’s Creed

At Haig Girls’ we believe in the importance of not just learning subjects, but learning how to learn. We believe that our girls can think, learn, achieve and excel, as stated in our pupil’s creed, thus, a great emphasis is placed on learning to learn and the power of the growth mindset. Since 2018, we have had termly Learning to Learn FTGP lessons and leverage intentional teachable moments in the school curriculum, CCAs, in and outside the classroom to develop a growth mindset in our students. Students learn about the importance of having a positive mindset, the power of mistakes, having resilience and learning strategies.&nbsp;

Gratitude
---------

  
At Haig Girls’ School, we believe in the importance of gratitude and cultivate it as a school through various assembly sessions and activities. Our students learn that being grateful allows them to celebrate the present and magnifies positive emotions. Gratitude turns what little one has into abundance. It involves so much more than just saying thank you and it truly changes one's perspective of the world. Showing gratitude at Haig Girls involves:&nbsp;

*   Gratitude to Self \[includes taking care of one-self and prioritising your own mental health and wellbeing, i.e. self-care\]  
      
    
*   Gratitude to Others  
      
    
*   Gratitude to the Environment&nbsp;

Family Time
-----------

Parents are the first care-givers in developing the good character of their children. The development of character and citizenship dispositions in our students is influenced by what happens in school, in the family and in the wider community. There must be active partnership between school and home so that what is taught and learnt in school is reinforced at home. In Haig Girls’, we believe in partnering with parents and have done so through various platforms such as CCE (FTGP) and CCE (MTL) student journals, our parent handouts on programmes (e.g. Growth Mindset / Gratitude), etc.

### National Education

National Education, first launched in 1997, is a significant aspect of Character &amp; Citizenship (CCE) in schools. It aims to:

Driven by the 2E2R approach of Explicit teaching, Experience, Reflection and Role-modelling, our programs focus on the Head, Heart and Hands of every Haig Girl, allowing every student to grow into a leader of character and an active and concerned citizen.&nbsp; We hope for our students to utilise their knowledge, skills and talents to serve the school and community, as depicted in our school motto - ‘Knowledge is Power, in service to others’. Our CCE Ambassadors, guided by the Citizenship Team of teachers, play a huge role in helming the assembly programs and helping to reinforce the key learning points and citizenship dispositions. This is part of our By Pupil for Pupil approach (BPFP) used in the planning of all our NE Core Events.

Purpose

The Social Studies curriculum spans the primary and secondary levels. This subject helps students to grow in knowledge, develop skills and learn values through examining issues that are of concern to our society and the world in which we live

Philosophy&nbsp;

At the heart of the Singapore Social Studies Curriculum is the preparation of our students to be effective citizens by helping them to better understand the interconnectedness of Singapore and the world they live in, and appreciate the complexities of the human experience. Drawing on aspects of society that are of meaning and interest to the students, Social Studies seeks to ignite students’ curiosity to inquire into real-world issues that concern their lives. Through inquiry and authentic learning experiences, Social Studies helps students to attain relevant knowledge and understanding about these issues, develop critical and reflective thinking skills, and appreciate multiple perspectives. Social Studies seeks to inculcate in students a deeper understanding of the values that define the Singapore society, nurture dispositions that will inspire them to show concern for the society and the world in which they live, and demonstrate empathy in their relationships with others.&nbsp;
