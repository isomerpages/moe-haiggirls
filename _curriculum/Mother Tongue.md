#### MOTHER TONGUE DEPARTMENT

The Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) Department aims to develop our HGS girls to be proficient in their MTL, becoming a confident and effective communicator who is rooted in values.

Our HGS girls also learn cultural values through different Mother Tongue programmes. Our Mother Tongue curriculum aims to make language learning more enjoyable. The key learning areas include listening, speaking, reading and writing. Through building a strong foundation from learning Chinese character to mastering the essay writing skills, HGS aims to deploy differentiated approach in ensuring that every girl is an engaged learner with a strong fundamental in language literacy.

### **Our Key Programmes**

**Festive Celebrations**

In order to promote multi-culturalism, the school celebrates Chinese New Year, Hari Raya Puasa, Deepavali and Mid-Autumn Festival so as to create awareness of the varied cultural backgrounds and values through authentic learning experience. Our girls get to know the origin of the various festive occasions and are exposed to the diverse culture in a fun and engaging manner.

**MTL Fortnight**

The MTL Fortnight aims to create an immersive and engaging environment for students to learn about their cultures and traditions through various cultural activities.

Some of the activities organised during the MTL Fortnight include:

·         Chinese New Year Celebration with class bonding activities

·         Virtual and physical learning journeys

·         Story-telling, drama and singing performances

·         Comic art drawing with themes related to MTL

·         Cultural hands-on activities such as finger painting, batik drawing etc.

**Reading Programme**

We hope to instil the love for reading as an integral part of Mother Tongue Languages learning. The HGS girls are engaged in reading their Mother Tongue Language books through the weekly silent reading programme and online reading portals. These platforms help to promote reading as well as emphasise on the importance of reading. Our girls participate in various activities after reading, such as creation of cards or book covers, book reviews and story-telling activities to reinforce learning.
