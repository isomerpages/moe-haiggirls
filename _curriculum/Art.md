Haig Girls’ adopts a holistic 3 learning-level approach to cultivate pupils’ informed appreciation of visual arts of different cultures, develop their creativity and art-making skills and integrate the visual arts into the curriculum and Character and Citizenship Education.  
  
The 3 learning levels of the programme promote breadth, depth and excellence in the visual arts:  
  
* Level 1 provides exposure to the visual arts for all pupils through: 
	1.  Art Instructional Programme  
	2.  Art Values-Based Creativity (VBC) Programmes  
	3.  infusion of the visual arts and design into Integrated Project Work (IPW), and  
	4.  school platforms which showcase the visual arts.
		
	
* Level 2 caters to pupils’ interests and develops their potential through the Art Club CCA.  
  
* Level 3 develops in greater depth the skills of pupils who are talented in the visual arts through D3T2 (Discover, Develop and Dedicate your Talent Time), a talent development programme.
