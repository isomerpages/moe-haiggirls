(embed youtube video of school song)

First in the class and first in the field,  
Strive to the last girls never yield.  
Hard though the struggle, stronger our will,  
Through life’s test, we’ll pass with zeal.  
For knowledge is power, the power we wield,  
It is our armour, our sword, our shield.  
  
**Chorus**  
Up with the colours – brown, amber, white,  
Haig Girls’ School will always fight.  
To keep to the one road that is right,  
Uphold our honour, shining bright.  
  
This is our school, our nation, our land,  
Steadfast and firm by each we stand.  
None shall challenge, none shall doubt,  
Our will’s strong, our hearts are stout.  
For knowledge is power, the power we wield,  
It is our armour, our sword, our shield.
