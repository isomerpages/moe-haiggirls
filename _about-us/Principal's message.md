<p>2023 had been an eventful year for Haig Girls’ School with most activities
resuming full steam post-Covid. The HGS community bade farewell to Ms Lo
Yen Nie, who gave 7 years of dedicated service as Principal, from December
2016 to December 2023. Ms Lo is well-loved and held in high esteem by the
school community and is undoubtedly missed.</p>
<p>Haig Girls’ School is a well-established school in the East of Singapore
with history dating back to 1951. The thousands of girls who have passed
through the gates of the school and the dedicated staff bear testimony
to the educational experience the school offered and still offers to our
Haig Girls today. For this, I would like to give thanks to those who have
gone before me and to the many who still work in the school.</p>
<p>Since reporting to the school in end October 2023, I have spent time getting
to know our girls, staff and stakeholders and hope to meet more of parents
and stakeholders at the upcoming school platforms. It is my firm belief
that there is no better way to know and understand our school than to interact
with our community. Through the many conversations that I have had with
our girls, staff and stakeholders (including parents, alumni, community
leaders and members of the School Advisory Committee (SAC)), I have been
inspired by the strong desire of the community to serve and contribute
– exemplifying the school motto of ‘Ars Potens Est’ – Knowledge is Power
in service to others, the school and the community. This is a fine example
of how the spirit of service has endured through the generations.</p>
<p>Having been educated in an all-girls’ school and likewise in my teaching
experience, I am grateful to be given the opportunity to serve in Haig
Girls’ School in my capacity as Principal. I endeavour to build on the
good work of my predecessors and add value to the school as we prepare
our girls to be future-ready – nurturing a sense of curiosity for learning,
discovering strengths for empowerment and developing character, including
resilience, for the long haul. For the journey ahead, I look to my staff
for their continued contribution and encouragement, to my students for
the Haig Girls’ zeal, and to you, parents, for your partnership and support.</p>
<p>Your girls are our girls. We are on the same side, wanting the best for
our children. When we walk hand-in-hand and do what is right by our children,
we would have nurtured our little ones and strengthened their foundation
for life.</p>
<p>In 2026, Haig Girls’ School will celebrate our 75th Anniversary. This
marks an important milestone for the school and for each of us who carries
cherished memories of our school. In the lead up to our anniversary celebrations,
we have planned a series of programmes and activities to reach out to our
ex-girls as well as to engage our current girls and stakeholders. We look
forward to your participation and involvement in the anniversary celebrations.
As we take steps to commemorate our anniversary, my staff, partners of
the school and I are engaged in collaborative, reflective conversations
that will culminate in a reimagining of our mission and vision statements,
prompting us to deeply understand both how our girls grow and learn and
how to bring about the practices, conditions and policies that set each
and every girl up to thrive. More updates will be provided during the course
of the year.</p>
<p>Thank you for your strong partnership.</p>
