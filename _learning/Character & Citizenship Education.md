<h2><strong>Character &amp; Citizenship Education</strong></h2>
<p>The HGS Character and Citizenship Education department envisions nurturing
compassionate, responsible, and engaged individuals. We aim to empower
every Haig girl to <strong>learn</strong>, <strong>lead</strong>, and <strong>serve</strong>,
equipping them with strong values, social-emotional competencies, and citizenship
skills to contribute meaningfully to their communities and navigate life
with confidence and purpose.</p>
<h3><strong>The CCE Curriculum Framework</strong></h3>
<p>The design of our school's CCE curriculum closely follows the MOE’s CCE2021
Curriculum Framework, while being anchored in our vision, mission, and
values.</p>

</div>
<p>The CCE curriculum is built around three core ideas: <strong>Identity</strong>, <strong>Relationships</strong>,
and <strong>Choices</strong>. It focuses on teaching core values and social-emotional
competencies while fostering a strong sense of purpose in students. These
principles are integrated into six key areas of learning: <strong>National Education (NE)</strong>, <strong>Sexuality Education (SEd)</strong>, <strong>Mental Health (MH)</strong>, <strong>Education and Career Guidance (ECG)</strong>, <strong>Cyber Wellness (CW)</strong>,
and <strong>Family Education (FE)</strong>.</p>

</div>
<p>CCE 2021 focuses on developing students' <strong>character</strong>, <strong>resilience</strong>, <strong>future readiness</strong>,
and <strong>active citizenship</strong>. It encourages a strong moral compass,
adaptability, and lifelong learning, while fostering national identity
and a commitment to contributing to society. The 3S1W dispositions—<strong>Sense of Belonging, Sense of Reality, Sense of Hope, </strong>and
the <strong>Will to Act</strong>—empower students to engage meaningfully
with their community and shape a better future.</p>

<p>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)&nbsp; is at the heart of education
in Singapore. Through CCE, students learn values, social-emotional competencies,
and develop character and citizenship dispositions that enable them to
grow holistically and learn for life. The CCE 2021 curriculum provides
an integrated approach to addressing our students’ development of values,
character, social-emotional well-being, and citizenship dispositions in
a coherent and holistic way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help our students adapt to disruptions in a rapidly evolving world,
the knowledge, skills, and values taught in CCE are current and relevant.
The CCE 2021 curriculum also helps our students navigate the realities
of their time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At Haig Girls’, we emphasise the importance of the character and citizenship
development of every student. Our student-centric and values-driven approach
helps nurture every student to become a leader of character and a concerned
citizen. We do so through reinforcing the I4Cs (Integrity, Concern, Commitment
and Cooperation) and 3S1W (Sense of Belonging, Sense of Reality, Sense
of Hope and the Will to act) in their experiences.</p>
<p>Values are explicitly taught and infused throughout the curriculum and
through role-modelling, reflection and experience. Service to the school
and community, leadership roles and responsibilities, CCAs and project
work are important experiences that we seek to give our students, so that
they can live out the school values in the process of serving others and
working with one another. Our programmes not only focus on the head but
also the heart and hands of every Haig Girl.</p>

<h3>Character Education</h3>
<p>Values are taught to our students through various platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) Lessons:
<br>- CCE Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP)
<br>- CCE Mother Tongue Language (MTL)
<br>- Programme for Active Learning (PAL) - P1 &amp; 2 only</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The infusion of values into existing academic curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assembly Programmes on&nbsp; Learning To Learn and Showing Gratitude&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Key Student Development Experiences (Co-Curricular Activities (CCA), leadership
programmes and camps)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) Lessons</p>
<p>CCE Lessons in Haig Girls are enacted through CCE Form Teacher Guidance
Period (FTGP) and CCE Mother Tongue Language (MTL). At Lower Primary, CCE
Lessons also include the Programme for Active Learning (PAL). CCE (FTGP),
CCE (MTL) and PAL are guided by one syllabus and the CCE Learning Outcomes
are realised in different ways. Lessons in CCE (FTGP) and CCE (MTL) use
stories, scenarios, songs and games, while PAL creates opportunities for
students to apply their learning through the domains of Sports &amp; Games,
Outdoor Education, Visual Arts, and Performing Arts.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<h5>CCE Form Teacher Guidance Period - CCE(FTGP)</h5>
<p>Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) provides quality interaction time
between form teachers and students, and equip students with social and
emotional competencies. We hope for our students to have a strong foundation
to build character, develop social-emotional competencies and citizenship
dispositions. There is emphasis on explicit teaching of social-emotional
competencies in CCE (FTGP) as the basic skills taught at the Primary levels
lay the foundation for more complex conversations and discussions at the
Secondary levels and beyond. Topics related to developing citizenship dispositions
are also taught in CCE (FTGP) to foster inter-ethnic understanding and
appreciation for one another’s culture in a multicultural classroom setting.</p>
<p>Sexuality Education (SEd) lessons are taught as part of CCE (FTGP) at
Primary 5 and 6. In SEd, students learn to understand the physiological,
social and emotional changes they experience as they mature. For example,
they learn about developing healthy and rewarding relationships, including
those with members of the opposite sex, and to make wise, informed and
responsible decisions on sexuality matters. Click <a href="https://www.haiggirls.moe.edu.sg/cce/moe-sexuality-education-in-schools/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> to
learn more about SEd in Haig Girls.</p>
<p>Education and Career Guidance (ECG) experiences in Haig Girls’ provide
an opportunity for our students&nbsp; to build their self-awareness and
knowledge of the different education and career pathways available. Through
the CCE (FTGP) curriculum, students get to discover their own values, strengths,
interests and skills in order to be better equipped to make informed choices
when selecting schools for secondary and tertiary education and thereafter
their career. Students also get to attend secondary school and careers
talks.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Above: CCE (FTGP) Student Journals&nbsp;</p>
<h5>CCE Mother Tongue Language - CCE(MTL)</h5>
<p>CCE (known as Civics and Moral Education (CME) prior to 2014) is taught
in the Mother Tongue Languages as they hold a rich source of knowledge
for the transmission of values. The teaching of CCE in the MTLs also provides
additional exposure time so as to improve students’ competency in Chinese,
Malay and Tamil. CCE (MTL) lessons share common unit titles with variations
in the lesson titles based on the cultural stories, practices, proverbs
or songs selected by each language. Cultural stories are used in the teaching
of CCE as:&nbsp;</p>
<p>• Values can be rather abstract for young children. Cultural stories help
children to reflect upon themselves through the lives of the characters
and make sense of experiences of life. Thus, children would strive to emulate
the values of the characters they read about.</p>
<p>• Cultural stories are rich in life experiences with the use of people
or animals in scenarios to bring out issues of identity, relationships
and choices.</p>
<p>• Cultural stories contain the culture, heritage and language of a community.
Children would gain a deeper understanding of their cultural heritage,
which comprises the traditions, rituals, crafts, expressions, knowledge
and skills that we practise and pass on from generation to generation.</p>
<p>• Stories from other cultures help develop and promote better understanding,
respect, appreciation, and a more positive outlook towards people from
different lands, races and religions.</p>
<p>Above: CCE (MTL) Student Journals for Primary Three</p>
<h5>Programme for Active Learning (PAL)</h5>
<p>PAL is an integral part of the curriculum for all Primary 1 and 2 students.
The programme offers hands-on and experiential learning through the following
four domains: Sports &amp; Games, Outdoor Education, Visual Arts, and Performing
Arts. PAL provides opportunities for students to discover new interests,
develop character and enables them to develop social-emotional competencies.
The five characteristics of PAL are as follow:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Focus on Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) and values;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be driven by experiential learning;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encompass learning in creative ways;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide opportunities to create; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engage in fun and enjoyable learning.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Learning To Learn</h2>
<p>We, the pupils of Haig Girls’ School believe that we can think, learn,
achieve and excel.
<br>We believe that we will be gracious, self-disciplined and responsible
citizens.
<br>~ HGS Pupil’s Creed</p>
<p>At Haig Girls’ we believe in the importance of not just learning subjects,
but learning how to learn. We believe that our girls can think, learn,
achieve and excel, as stated in our pupil’s creed, thus, a great emphasis
is placed on learning to learn and the power of the growth mindset. Since
2018, we have had termly Learning to Learn FTGP lessons and leverage intentional
teachable moments in the school curriculum, CCAs, in and outside the classroom
to develop a growth mindset in our students. Students learn about the importance
of having a positive mindset, the power of mistakes, having resilience
and learning strategies.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2>Gratitude</h2>
<p>At Haig Girls’ School, we believe in the importance of gratitude and cultivate
it as a school through various assembly sessions and activities. Our students
learn that being grateful allows them to celebrate the present and magnifies
positive emotions. Gratitude turns what little one has into abundance.
It involves so much more than just saying thank you and it truly changes
one's perspective of the world. Showing gratitude at Haig Girls involves:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Gratitude to Self [includes taking care of one-self and prioritising your
own mental health and wellbeing, i.e. self-care]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gratitude to Others</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gratitude to the Environment&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>

Week @ HGS</p>
<h2>Family Time</h2>
<p>Parents are the first care-givers in developing the good character of
their children. The development of character and citizenship dispositions
in our students is influenced by what happens in school, in the family
and in the wider community. There must be active partnership between school
and home so that what is taught and learnt in school is reinforced at home.
In Haig Girls’, we believe in partnering with parents and have done so
through various platforms such as CCE (FTGP) and CCE (MTL) student journals,
our parent handouts on programmes (e.g. Growth Mindset / Gratitude), etc.</p>
<h3>National Education</h3>
<p>National Education, first launched in 1997, is a significant aspect of
Character &amp; Citizenship (CCE) in schools. It aims to:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Driven by the 2E2R approach of Explicit teaching, Experience, Reflection
and Role-modelling, our programs focus on the Head, Heart and Hands of
every Haig Girl, allowing every student to grow into a leader of character
and an active and concerned citizen.&nbsp; We hope for our students to
utilise their knowledge, skills and talents to serve the school and community,
as depicted in our school motto - ‘Knowledge is Power, in service to others’.
Our CCE Ambassadors, guided by the Citizenship Team of teachers, play a
huge role in helming the assembly programs and helping to reinforce the
key learning points and citizenship dispositions. This is part of our By
Pupil for Pupil approach (BPFP) used in the planning of all our NE Core
Events.</p>

<p>Above: Our dedicated group of Social Studies teachers &amp; snippets of
Social Studies lessons in action</p>
<p>Purpose</p>
<p>The Social Studies curriculum spans the primary and secondary levels.
This subject helps students to grow in knowledge, develop skills and learn
values through examining issues that are of concern to our society and
the world in which we live</p>
<p>Philosophy&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the heart of the Singapore Social Studies Curriculum is the preparation
of our students to be effective citizens by helping them to better understand
the interconnectedness of Singapore and the world they live in, and appreciate
the complexities of the human experience. Drawing on aspects of society
that are of meaning and interest to the students, Social Studies seeks
to ignite students’ curiosity to inquire into real-world issues that concern
their lives. Through inquiry and authentic learning experiences, Social
Studies helps students to attain relevant knowledge and understanding about
these issues, develop critical and reflective thinking skills, and appreciate
multiple perspectives. Social Studies seeks to inculcate in students a
deeper understanding of the values that define the Singapore society, nurture
dispositions that will inspire them to show concern for the society and
the world in which they live, and demonstrate empathy in their relationships
with others.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Curriculum Aims of Social Studies&nbsp;</p>
<p>As informed citizens, students will:&nbsp;</p>
<p>• understand the rights and responsibilities of citizens and the role
of the government in society;&nbsp;</p>
<p>• understand their identity as Singaporeans, with a regional and global
outlook</p>
<p>• understand the Singapore perspective on key national, regional and global
issues&nbsp;</p>
<p>• analyse and negotiate complex issues through evaluating multiple sources
with different perspectives&nbsp;</p>
<p>• arrive at well-reasoned, responsible decisions through reflective thought
and discernment</p>
<p>As concerned citizens, students will:&nbsp;</p>
<p>• have a sense of belonging to the nation, appreciate and be committed
to building social cohesion in a diverse society</p>
<p>• be motivated to engage in issues of societal concern</p>
<p>• reflect on the ethical considerations and consequences of decision making.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As participative citizens, students will:&nbsp;</p>
<p>• take responsible personal and collective actions to effect change for
the good of society</p>
<p>• be resilient in addressing concerns of society in spite of challenges
faced.</p>

<h3>Learning Journeys</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Above: Snippets of our P4- 6 Learning Journeys and parents that have come
along to support us</p>
<p>Cohort LJs have been developed to provide all students with opportunities
to explore their Singaporean identity through the arts, culture and heritage.
These complement our national Art, Character and Citizenship Education
and Social Studies curricula.</p>
<p>Cohort LJs consist of the Primary 5 NE Show, Museum-Based Learning (MBL)
and learning journeys that are part of our ALP-IPW (Integrated Project
Work).</p>
<p>Fig: Overview of Cohort Learning Journeys</p>
<h3>Museum-Based Learning</h3>
<p>Our MBL (CCE, History and Social Studies) and signature P4 IPW TIMEOUT
program aims to enable a more inclusive and authentic learning experience
for students in art, heritage and history through pre-, during- and post-visit
lessons to Singapore’s art museums and historical sites. As these LJs are
designed to achieve respective syllabus outcomes, including the development
of citizenship dispositions and national identity in students, our students
go through these compulsory cohort LJs at the designated academic level
and in all three phases (i.e. pre-, during and post-learning journey).</p>
<p>The pre-visit experience arouses students' interest, activates their prior
knowledge and provides relevant context to allow students to form deeper
and more meaningful connections to the new knowledge and experiences gained
during the visit. The post-visit experience provides time and space for
students to review, reflect and help them make connections between what
they already know or have experienced within their lives and across the
curriculum.</p>
<p>All the MBL experiences are facilitated by museum educators with expertise
in content on both the galleries and artefacts at the respective sites,
further reinforced by our Social Studies teachers in class.</p>
<p>The MBL (CCE, History and Social Studies) are developed around the following
themes and questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;Themes</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Our Singapore Way: Our Multicultural Heritage&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our Singapore Spirit: Turning Challenges into Opportunities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our Singapore Story: Growing Singapore Together</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Key Questions&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How do I demonstrate respect for and appreciation of diversity?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What does being Singaporean and/or living in Singapore mean to me?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can I be an advocate for positive change in the community and society?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are some local, global, social and environmental issues that I care
about?</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>We commemorate Total Defence Day on 15 February each year to mark the
fall of Singapore to the Japanese in 1942. In commemorating TDD, our students
reflect on the importance of Total Defence as Singapore's best all-round
response to threats and challenges that confront Singapore (e.g. terrorism,
pandemics, cyber-attacks, influence campaigns or economic crises). Students
also reflect on the continuing relevance of the six pillars of Total Defence
- Military Defence, Civil Defence, Economic Defence, Social Defence, Digital
Defence and Psychological Defence - as well as the core message of every
Singaporean standing together, each playing our part to protect Singapore
and our shared way of life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We commemorate International Friendship Day on the 3rd Friday of Term
2. This is a day dedicated to the understanding of Singapore's relations
with neighbouring countries and beyond. The commemoration of IFD allows
our students to be sensitised to Singapore's geopolitical realities, and
to reflect on the importance of a) an active foreign policy to maintain
Singapore's international space; b) openness to the international flow
of trade, ideas and talent; c) cross-cultural skills and a global orientation;
and d) the spirit of friendship and collaboration amongst different people.
Through our specially planned assembly program and NE Focused CCE (FTGP)
lessons, our students are acquainted with the diverse and colourful culture
and traditions of the region and the lives of their peers in other ASEAN
Member-States. We also nurture in them the spirit of friendship and collaboration
among different peoples in ASEAN and beyond, on top of having them keep
an open mindset and express an appreciation of the contributions of foreigners
living, working and studying in Singapore.</p>
<h3>As part of school efforts to promote foreigner-local integration, experiences have been designed for the foreign students in our midst to have:&nbsp;</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Mutual understanding, appreciation, and acceptance among students of different
lifestyles and cultural backgrounds</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spirit of friendship and social values of collaboration</p>

supported by our very lovely Parents Support Group (PSG)</p>
<p>We commemorate Racial Harmony Day (RHD) on 21 July each year to mark the
anniversary of the 1964 race riots. On this day, students reflect on and
celebrate Singapore as a harmonious society built on a rich diversity of
cultures and the collaborative effort of all to promote social cohesion.
As part of our commemoration, we facilitate activities that enable our
students to make friends with people of other races and religions and reinforce
the message that in Singapore, people are treated equally regardless of
their race and religion, and that students should appreciate the
<br>different cultures that make up Singapore.&nbsp;</p>

<p>National Day marks our separation from Malaysia in 1965, and our emergence
as an independent country in a community of nations. The school-based commemoration
brings to students a sense of the historical importance and solemnity of
National Day. As part of our National Day celebrations at Haig Girls, we
provide our students with a platform to live out the school’s vision of
being leaders of character through engaging in active citizenry. We remind
our students of the importance of giving and emphasize on instilling a
heart of gratitude in our students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of our Bags of Blessings initiative through the years, we have
reached out to various groups of people in society (e.g. Residents at Marine
Parade flats, migrant workers, frontline &amp; healthcare workers, the
less fortunate children and youths residing in homes &amp; shelters etc).
This outreach helps provide an opportunity for our students to embrace
the power of giving, to think about others before themselves and believe
that anyone, regardless of their age, is able to give back to the community
and make a positive difference to another person.</p>
<p>Our Parents Support Group would hold a yearly charity book drive in conjunction
with our National Day celebrations. They would collect pre-loved books
from our students and staff and sell them during recess to students and
teachers. Proceeds from the book drive would then be donated fully to our
students in need.</p>
<h3>Values In Action</h3>
<p>Service to the school and community, leadership roles and responsibilities,
CCAs and group work are important experiences that we give our students,
so that they can live out the school values in the process of serving others
and working with one another.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Integrated Project Work (IPW)</h3>
<p>IPW is a school-wide programme that helps students to integrate learning
and create new value through an interdisciplinary approach. IPW provides
students with the opportunities to appreciate the culture and heritage
of their community, to develop a sense of belonging and pride as well as
to play a role in active citizenship. This ties in with the 2E2R approach
of Explicit teaching, Experience, Role-Modeling and Reflection.</p>

<h3>Student Leadership Development Programme</h3>
<p>**</p>
<p>The student leadership development programme is designed to develop every
student as a leader of character. Every student will be given an opportunity
to be a leader, beginning at the class level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The four HGS leadership attributes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>lead by example</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>serve with humility</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>take initiative, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>influence others positively</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Click&nbsp;<a href="https://www.haiggirls.moe.edu.sg/images/sldpledge.jpeg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>&nbsp;for
the Student Leaders’ Pledge.</p>
<p>Student Leaders’ Investiture</p>
<p>The annual student leaders’ investiture is held in the first semester
during assembly. At this investiture, student leaders (ranging from Character
Citizenship Education ambassadors to CCA leaders and Prefects will be formally
acknowledged and presented with specific badges by the Principal and Vice-Principals.
At the same time, the investiture serves as an opportunity to acknowledge
that every student in HGS is a leader.</p>
<p>Student Leadership Framework</p>
<p>We believe that every HGS student will be a leader of character who&nbsp;demonstrates
our school&nbsp;values (I4Cs) and leadership attributes. Our school’s Student
Leadership Development Committee has created a Student Leadership Framework
to ensure all our students are nurtured to be a leader.</p>
<p>The Student Leadership Framework is built on HGS’ vision of “Leaders of
Character, Striving for Excellence in a Vibrant School”. It has four concentric
circles with the inner circles depicting the values and leadership attributes,
while the outer circles illustrate the platforms and approaches for students
to hone their leadership skills.&nbsp;</p>

</div>
<p>The first inner circle indicates our school values (I4Cs) – Integrity,
Commitment, Cooperation, Creativity&nbsp;and Concern, which we would like
to inculcate in every Haig girl.</p>
<p>The second inner circle indicates the leadership attributes – “Leads by
Example”, “Takes Initiative”, “Serves with Humility” and “Influences Others
Positively” which further build upon the fundamental school values of I4Cs.</p>
<p>The third outer circle shows the platforms (CCA Leaders, Class Leaders,
Ambassadors and Prefects) that we have designed to provide our Haig girl
the opportunity to take on authentic leadership roles.</p>
<p>Finally, the outermost circle depicts the 2E2R approach - “Experience”,
“Explicit teaching”, “Reflection” and “Role-modelling”, used to cultivate
the leadership qualities in our students.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Through explicit teaching and by providing students with experiences (e.g.
FTGP Leadership Lessons, Leadership Training, Leadership Opportunities),
all students will be able to develop their leadership capabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We also empower our students to lead in events such as the&nbsp;TKSS Junior
Leadership Symposium, Leadership Assembly Presentations and the HGS Open
House. No Haig girl is too young to make a difference to others, the school
and the community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore, we encourage the students to reflect and evaluate their own
strengths and missteps in their leadership journey. Using a growth mindset
for self-reflection coupled with peer evaluation will help solidify their
understanding of what it takes to be a good leader.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We also provide affirmation and encouragement through events such as the
Student Leaders’ Investiture and Prize-Giving Day. We celebrate not only
achievements but the hearts of our students.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Leadership Training Structure</p>
<p>To support the students in developing their leadership skills, a three-tiered&nbsp;training
structure was&nbsp;created.</p>

<p>3-Tiered Student
<br>Leadership Training</p>
<p>In addition to the above key training programmes, there would be specialised
training programmes catered for different groups of leaders so as to hone
their skills in the specific areas.</p>
