<h2><strong>Character &amp; Citizenship Education</strong></h2>
<p>The HGS Character and Citizenship Education department envisions nurturing
compassionate, responsible, and engaged individuals. We aim to empower
every Haig girl to <strong>learn</strong>, <strong>lead</strong>, and <strong>serve</strong>,
equipping them with strong values, social-emotional competencies, and citizenship
skills to contribute meaningfully to their communities and navigate life
with confidence and purpose.</p>
<h3><strong>The CCE Curriculum Framework</strong></h3>
<p>The design of our school's CCE curriculum closely follows the MOE’s CCE2021
Curriculum Framework, while being anchored in our vision, mission, and
values.</p>

<p>The CCE curriculum is built around three core ideas: <strong>Identity</strong>, <strong>Relationships</strong>,
and <strong>Choices</strong>. It focuses on teaching core values and social-emotional
competencies while fostering a strong sense of purpose in students. These
principles are integrated into six key areas of learning: <strong>National Education (NE)</strong>, <strong>Sexuality Education (SEd)</strong>, <strong>Mental Health (MH)</strong>, <strong>Education and Career Guidance (ECG)</strong>, <strong>Cyber Wellness (CW)</strong>,
and <strong>Family Education (FE)</strong>.</p>

<p>CCE 2021 focuses on developing students' <strong>character</strong>, <strong>resilience</strong>, <strong>future readiness</strong>,
and <strong>active citizenship</strong>. It encourages a strong moral compass,
adaptability, and lifelong learning, while fostering national identity
and a commitment to contributing to society. The 3S1W dispositions—<strong>Sense of Belonging, Sense of Reality, Sense of Hope, </strong>and
the <strong>Will to Act</strong>—empower students to engage meaningfully
with their community and shape a better future.</p>
