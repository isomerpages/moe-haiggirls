In Haig Girls’ School, we believe that our girls can think, learn, achieve & excel. 

Our students are diverse, with different needs, interests, and aptitudes for Science. Given the diversity of our students and the needs of our country, the twin goals of Science education are to:

• Enthuse and nurture all students to be scientifically literate, so that they will be able to make informed decisions and take responsible actions in their daily lives; and

• Provide strong Science fundamentals for students to innovate and pursue STEM for future learning and work. 

Inspire, Inquire and Innovate represent the vision for Science Education and encapsulates the overall experience of our students in Science education.

Teaching And Learning Through Inquiry

We envision students to enjoy learning Science and to value Science in their everyday lives (e.g. to make informed decisions and take responsible actions, such as in personal health and caring for the environment).

We believe that all students are curious and want to explore and learn about things around them. We seek to nurture students as inquirers by providing opportunities for them to explore and to appreciate the role of Science for Life and Society.

To nurture students as inquirers, teachers are key in facilitating a variety of learning experiences to support students in understanding core ideas, developing practices and cultivating values, ethics, and attitudes. These learning experiences can be situated in various authentic contexts in both formal and informal settings. The experiences should inspire students to inquire and innovate. 

The teaching and learning approaches centre around the student as an inquirer. The teacher is the leader of inquiry in the science classroom who creates a learning environment that will encourage and challenge students to develop their sense of inquiry.

Our teachers use a variety of teaching strategies to facilitate the inquiry process with the aim to engage students in meaningful learning experiences and cultivate their interest and curiosity in science. 

  

Hands-On Learning

To engage students in the learning of Science, hands-on activities help students make connections from concrete to abstract. The hands-on learning experiences are also extended to be situated in realistic contexts so that students can make connections with their own lives and the environment in which they live. Various strategies, such as model-making, story writing, are designed for students to display their understanding and application of concepts.

#### Harnessing Technology for Teaching and Learning

At Haig Girls’ School, we believe that learning does not need to be restricted to the classroom. Technology enables students to do flipped learning independently at home and encourages them to be self-directed learners. Students work collaboratively using ICT platforms, such as SLS, Padlet, Knowledge Forum and Google classroom. Teachers harness technology to carry out virtual experiments through simulations.

###  Holistic Assessment to Support Learning

Assessment is integral to the learning process. Performance tasks develop students’ abilities to think critically and apply their process skills and Science knowledge in designing and creating products based on scientific concepts. Other assessment modes to provide useful information that supports student’s learning and holistic development include journaling, peer and self-assessment, exit cards, use of checklists and rubrics and use of mini whiteboards and traffic lights.  

  
**Science D3T2 (Discover, Develop & Dedicate your Talent Time)**

Science D3T2 is a school-based talent development programme for upper primary students with an aptitude and keen interest in science. The school has embarked on the E2K Science Programme Singapore, an enrichment programme specially developed by the Ministry of Education (Gifted Education Branch). It aims to develop scientific inquiry process skills and nurture 21st century competencies such as resilience and resourcefulness, critical and inventive thinking, and effective communication skills. Through collaborative learning, students practise scientific thinking and reasoning, develop confidence and independence in scientific inquiry and habits, attitudes and dispositions.

Learning of Science beyond the classroom

World of Wonders (W.O.W) @ Recess

To encourage learning beyond classroom, W.O.W (World of Wonders) @ Recess takes place during recesses termly at the foyer. It is facilitated by our science ambassadors, with the help of parent volunteers. Students from all levels have fun exploring and learning new Science concepts through interesting activities. This programme aims to stimulate students’ interest in science and develop their inquiry skills as they engage in exploratory learning. They learn to construct their understanding about science concepts and connect Science to their everyday lives.

Science Busking@Recess 

Students showcase their creativity in the Sony Creative Science competition where they make innovative toys that work using science concepts, such as magnetism, electricity and forces. Students then present their creations during recess and students from all levels get the opportunity to try out the toys.
