<h3><strong>Teaching And Learning Through Inquiry</strong></h3>
<p>We nurture students as inquirers by fostering curiosity and providing
authentic learning experiences. Our teachers use a variety of teaching
strategies to facilitate the inquiry process and design meaningful learning
experiences that develop scientific skills and knowledge, give students
the opportunity to demonstrate 21CC competencies and values, while inspiring
them to explore and question.</p>
<h3><strong>Hands-On Learning</strong></h3>
<p>Hands-on activities help students connect concrete experiences to abstract
concepts in real-life contexts. Strategies like model-making and storytelling
deepen understanding and application of scientific ideas.</p>

<h3><strong>Holistic Assessment to Support Learning</strong></h3>
<p>Assessment is integral to the learning process. Performance tasks develop
students to think critically and apply their process skills and Science
knowledge.. Other assessment modes like journaling, peer and self-assessment,
exit cards, checklists, rubrics and mini whiteboards offer valuable insights
to support their learning and growth.</p>
<h3><strong>Science D3T2 (Discover, Develop &amp; Dedicate your Talent Time)</strong></h3>
<p>Science D3T2 is a school-based talent development programme for upper
primary students with an aptitude and keen interest in science. It leverages
on the E2K Science Programme, developed by the Ministry of Education, to
develop scientific inquiry and process skills and 21st century competencies
like resilience, resourcefulness, critical and inventive thinking, and
effective communication through collaborative learning and hands-on inquiry.</p>

<h3><strong>Learning Science beyond the classroom</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>World of Wonders (W.O.W) @ Recess</strong></h4>
<p>W.O.W (World of Wonders) @ Recess is a termly event at the foyer led by
Science Ambassadors and parent volunteers. Students from all levels explore
exciting new Science concepts through interesting activities, sparking
curiosity, developing inquiry skills connecting Science to their everyday
lives in a fun and engaging way.</p>

<h3><strong>Learning Journeys</strong></h3>
<p>Students visit the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum, exploring Singapore’s
historical species. They learn about the history of life on Earth, environmental
issues, and conservation efforts. Through observation and hands-on activities,
students identify animal groups and their characteristics, connecting classroom
learning to real-world biodiversity. Students also visit the Singapore
Science Centre to explore interactive exhibits and deepen their understanding
of scientific concepts. They attend an engaging workshop that brings Science
to life, with student volunteers assisting in exciting experiments, making
learning hands-on, immersive, and memorable.</p>

<h3><strong>Green Spaces and Practices</strong></h3>
<p>The school integrates green spaces and sustainable practices to nurture
environmental responsibility. The Green Corner, Science Garden, and eco-pond
enable students to explore conservation and biodiversity, enriching learning
with real-world applications of conservation and biodiversity. Programmes
like Earth Week and the Clean Plate Campaign raise awareness of environmental
and sustainability issues, while talks led by our Green Leaders and invited
speakers inspire action. Through these initiatives, students develop a
deeper understanding of environmental stewardship and are empowered to
make a positive impact on the world around them.</p>
