Are you interested to join our group of Parent Volunteers (PV)? This is for parents who are interested to register their child/ward in Haig Girls’ School at Phase 2B of the P1 Registration Exercise.

We will open the application one year before the student is due for P1 registration. For example, if your child/ward is born in 2018 and going to P1 in 2025, the P1 registration will be in 2024. Application for the PV will start on 1 April 2023 and close on 31 May 2023 for 2024 P1 Registration.

If you are interested to join our PV group, please submit your application through this [online form](https://form.gov.sg/635b4bb383d9150011f0aa57) by 31 May 2023.
