##### Our Staff culture - ‘Care, Collegiality and Innovation undergirded by a sense of stewardship’


Care signifies a genuine concern and empathy for colleagues and stakeholders to foster an environment where the staff feel valued, respected, and supported, which in turn promotes collaboration, productivity, and overall well-being.

Collegiality refers to the spirit of cooperation, collaboration, and teamwork among staff members which emphasizes the importance of building positive relationships, mutual respect, and a sense of community.

Innovation implies a willingness to explore new ideas and seek creative solutions to problems. It involves cultivating a culture that encourages experimentation, risk-taking, and continuous learning and growth.

Stewardship embodies a sense of responsibility and accountability to uphold the school's vision and mission.

Overall, this staff culture framework promotes a positive and collaborative work environment where individuals are cared for, work together harmoniously, are empowered to innovate, and act as responsible stewards.

This strong culture has resulted in school-based innovations and action research projects in a wide range of subjects and inter-disciplinary areas. Our teachers are recognised for their curriculum innovations and professional development.

Our teachers have conducted professional sharing sessions at national and international platforms, making a positive impact on the education fraternity.
